These programs illustrate the basic mechanisms of subroutines,
including procedures and functions.

- [[./Jal.asm.txt][Jal]]  Illustrate the jump and link (jal)
  instruction, which is the foundation for subroutines.

- [[./Subroutine.asm.txt][Subroutine]] A simple subroutine,
  demonstrating call and return.
  
- [[./OverwriteReturnAddress.asm.txt][OverwriteReturnAddress]]

- [[./zapR13crash.asm.txt][zapR13crash]] Show what happens if the
  program doesn't save the return address properly: the program
  crashes.

- [[./SaveR13stack.asm.txt][SaveR13stack]]  The program saves the
  return address properly.
  
- [[./Factorial.asm.txt][Factorial]]  A program that calculates
  factorials using recursion.  There are much better ways to compute
  factorials, but this program gives a relatively simple example of
  how recursion works.

    <h1>Sigma16</h1>

    <p> Sigma16 is a computer architecture designed for research and
        teaching in computer systems.
    </p>
    <p> This application provides a complete environment for
        experimenting with the architecture, including an editor,
        assembler, linker, emulator, and an integrated development
        environment.  There is a digital circuit that implements the
        architecture, which is specified using the Hydra functional
        hardware description language.  Hydra can simulate the
        circuit, and machine language programs can run on both the
        emulator and the circuit.

; Relocatable: Test assembly of relocatable and nonrelocatable addresses.
; Contains some names that are relocatable, others that are fixed.
; Sigma16: https://jtod.github.io/home/Sigma16  John O'Donnell, 2023

; Assembler test cases for determination of relocatability of names.
; This program isn't for execution, just for testing the assembler.

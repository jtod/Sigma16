; addc is the "add with carry" instruction.  It's useful for addition
; of large natural numbers that require several words.  The
; instruction uses the carry bit in the condition code (R15) as the
; carry input, and it overwrites the carry bit with the carry output
; of the addition.  There is no overflow.  The numbers used here are
; binary natural numbers.

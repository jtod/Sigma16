; Div: Example of division.
; Calculate both quotient (in destination register) and remainder (R15).

; div is an RRR instruction, but unlike most RRR instructions it
; produces two results: the quotient is placed in the destination
; register, and the remainder is placed in R15.  If the destination
; register is R15, then the quotient goes into R15 and the remainder
; is discarded.

; This instruction does not set the condition code, as R15 is needed
; for the remainder.  The condition code isn't needed for div, as the
; only useful codition would be an indication of division by 0.  There
; are two ways to detect division by 0: you can use an interrupt, or
; you can compare the divisor with 0.

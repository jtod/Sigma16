Sigma16 is a computer architecture designed for research and teaching
in computer systems.  This application provides a complete environment
for experimenting with the architecture, including an editor,
assembler, linker, emulator, and an integrated development
environment.

There is also a digital circuit, available separately, that
implements the architecture.  The circuit is specified using the
Hydra functional hardware description language.  Hydra can simulate
the circuit, and machine language programs can run on both the
emulator and the circuit.

** Getting started

The User Guide begins with a set of tutorials that introduce the
system.  The best place to start is with the *Hello, World!* tutorial.
After working through the tutorials, see the rest of the User Guide
for detailed documentation.

latest version as well as up-to-date information on the system.  It's
best to bookmark the home page, not this specific release.  If you

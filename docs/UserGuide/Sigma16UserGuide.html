There are additional command line tools that can run in a
shell; see the Installation section.  There is also a digital
circuit (available separately) that implements the
architecture, as well as a functional hardware description
language, Hydra, that simulates circuits.  Using these tools,
machine language programs can run on both the emulator and
the circuit.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-3">
<p>
The architecture is organized into subsets to make it easier
to learn and to use:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The <b>Core</b> subset has a small instruction set which is a
good starting point for learning about computer
architecture.  Although simple, Core is powerful enough to
support realistic programming.</li>

<li>The <b>Standard</b> subset offers flexible programming
techniques, including manipulation of bits, Boolean
expressions, shifting, extracting fields, arithmetic on
natural numbers and arbitrary precision integers, and
concise support for stack frames. It also supports the
study of systems programming, providing interrupts,
protection, concurrent processes, mutual exclusion, and
memory management.</li>
</ul>

<p>
For a quick start, begin with the Core tutorials, which
introduce the architecture step by step.  The tutorials
explain the machine, show how to program it, and demonstrate
how to enter and run a program and how to use the programming
environment.  A reference section follows the tutorials.
</p>

<p>
The architecture focuses on fundamental concepts and
principles.  Sigma16 illustrates the basic ideas of computer
systems while avoiding unnecessary complexity. Most
commercial computers that achieve success in the marketplace
evolve through updates and extensions, and eventually become
encrusted with complications that help support backward
compatibility but that lead to complexity.

<p>
Let's begin by running a simple example program.  For now, we
focus only on how to use the software tools.  You don't need
to understand the example code yet.  An explanation of the
program and the Sigma16 architecture will come later.
</p>

<p>
To launch the app, visit the Sigma16 Home Page and click on
the link to run it.  Sigma16 runs in the browser; you don't
need to download or install anything.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Click <b>Editor</b>, then <b>Hello, world!</b>.  This will enter a
small assembly language program into the editor window.
Later, we'll load some of the more complex example programs
into the editor, and you can also modify a program or type
in a new one from scratch.  For now, don't worry about the
content of the program.</li>

<li>Click <b>Assembler</b>.  The assembler translates programs in
assembly language (the source program) to machine language
(the object program).  Assembly language is a
human-readable notation, while machine language is what the
computer can execute.  When you first enter the Assembler
tab, the assembly language text in the Editor window is
copied over; this is the source program.</li>

<li>Click the <b>Assemble</b> button.  This will do the translation.
The <b>assembly listing</b> is displayed: this shows the
original source code along with the machine language, and
any error messages.  The <b>Show object</b> button displays the
object code, which is the machine language program produced
by the translation.  The <b>Show source</b> button displays the
original source code, and the <b>Show Listing</b> button
displays the assembly listing again.</li>

<li>For this simple example, we don't need the Linker, so you
can skip it.  The linker is needed for larger and more
complex programs with multiple modules, or with external
references, or that need relocation.</li>

<li>Click <b>Processor</b>, which shows the main components of the
computer architecture, including registers and memory.
These components are explained later.  For now, just note
that this page is where you can run programs using the
emulator.</li>

<li>Still on the Processor page, click <b>Boot</b>.  This reads the
machine language program into the memory, and you can see
it in the Memory display.  The source code (the assembly
language) appears in the bottom section.  If the assembler
produced any error messages, the program will not boot
until you fix the errors.</li>

<li><p>
Click <b>Step</b>.  The processor executes a single instruction
and displays the effects on the registers and memory: blue
for <i>using</i> a value, and red for <i>modifying</i> it.  The
assembly listing shows the instruction that just executed
by highlighting it in red.  It also shows the instruction
that will execute next by highlighting it in blue.  This is
just to make it easier to follow what is happening; the
machine executes the machine language program, which is in
memory, and it ignores the assembly language listing which
is just a convenience to help you follow the program.  The
machine relies only on the registers and memory, and
doesn't even "know" that the assembly listing exists.
</p>

<p>
There is a keyboard shortcut: after you have clicked Step
once, you can press the space bar to execute the next
instruction.  Thus you can step through the program by
clicking Step, and then pressing the space bar repeatedly.
</p></li>

<li>Click Step repeatedly to watch the program execute,
instruction by instruction.  When the program terminates,
the small window labelled <b>Emulator</b> will display <b>Halted</b>.</li>

<li>You can also run the program to completion, without having
to click Step so many times.  Click <b>Boot</b> again to get the
machine back into the initial state.  Now click <b>Run</b>, and
the program will continue executing instructions until it
halts.</li>
</ul>

<p>
To run the program slowly, click Step repeatedly.  To run the
program faster but without updating the display after each
instruction, click Run.  At any time you can click Pause to
stop the processor, and you can resume execution with either
Step or Run.  Sometimes it's useful to let the processor run
at full speed until it reaches a particular instruction, and
then stop.  This can be done by setting a <b>breakpoint</b>
(described in the Breakpoint tutorial below).
</p>

<p>
To exit the app, just close the browser window or tab.  This
may put up a dialogue box warning that any unsaved data may
be lost and asking you to confirm.

This tutorial introduces the main components of the
architecture as well as the graphical user interface.
</p>

<p>
The main window contains two main sections.  The largest
area, on the left side, is the <b>main working area</b>.  When the
program launches, this will show the Welcome page.  The <b>user
guide</b> is on the right side.  At the top is a row of buttons
(Welcome, Examples, etc.).  These select which page is
displayed in the main working area.
</p>

<p>
It's convenient to see the main working area and the user
guide side by side.  Begin by resizing the entire window
(bigger is better).  Then you can change the amount of space
given to the user guide by clicking the arrow symbols on the
right side of the top button bar.  These arrows will expand
or shrink the user guide: the small arrows adjust by one
pixel, the larger arrows by ten pixels.  If you resize the
entire browser window, Sigma16 will maintain the same
relative sizes of the main working area and the user guide
sections.
</p>

<p>
If your screen is small, and the main working area isn't big
enough, click <i>Hide User Guide</i> and all the space will be
made available to it.  The button will change to <i>Show User
Guide</i>.
</p>

<p>
You can also open the User Guide in a separate browser tab or
window.  The Welcome page contains a link to do this.
</p>

<p>
The main working area has several pages, with tab buttons at
the top to switch between them:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>Welcome</b> contains some introductory information and links.</li>

<li><b>Examples</b> contains a collection of assembly language
programs organized by the architecture subset.  Start with
the Core examples.</li>

<li><b>Modules</b> shows a summary of all the files and modules you
currently have open.  It also provides buttons allowing you
to open files on your computer, close them, and select one
to work on.</li>

<li><b>Editor</b> shows the selected module, where it can be edited.
You can assemble and execute the selected module.  To run a
program, you'll load it into the Editor (there are several
ways to do this), then assemble it (Assembler tab) and then
run it (Processor tab).</li>

<li><b>Assembler</b> translates a program from assembly language to
machine language, and shows the assembly listing as well as
the object code.</li>

<li><b>Linker</b> is used to combine a collection of object code
modules into a single executable program.  It also performs
external name resolution and relocation.  Programs that
consist of just one module do not need the linker, and you
can skip it.</li>

<li><b>Processor</b> shows the components of the architecture and
executes machine language programs.</li>

<li><b>Options</b> allows you to configure how the system operates.</li>

<li><b>About</b> gives general information about the software,
including the version.</li>

<li><b>Hide User Guide</b> makes the entire window available to the
main working area.  It is a toggle that changes to <b>Show
User Guide</b>.</li>

<div id="outline-container-org4c59d15" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org4c59d15"><span class="section-number-3">2.3.</span> Registers, constants, and arithmetic</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-3">
<p>
Programs do most of their work using the <b>register file</b>,
which is an array of 16 registers named R0, R1, R2, &#x2026;, R15.
The Register File is displayed in a box on the Processor
page.
</p>

<p>
A register is a circuit that can hold a number, and the
elements of the register file can be used to hold variable
values.  They are analogous to the registers in a calculator:
think of each register as a box that can hold a number, and
think of the register name as a variable name.  Two of the
registers, R0 and R15, are special and should not be used to
hold variables.
</p>

<p>
A computer program is a sequence of <b>instructions</b>.
Instructions are similar to statements in a programming
language, but they are simpler.
</p>

<p>
Sigma16 performs arithmetic on data in registers.  To do any
computation on some numbers, we first need to get those
numbers into registers.  The <b>lea</b> instruction. can be used
to place a constant into a register.  For example, to load 42
into register 3, write
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-Sigma16">     lea  R3,42[R0]     ; R3 := 42
</pre>
</div>

<p>
This is a statement in <b>assembly language</b>, and it describes
one instruction.  This statement contains three parts:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The <b>operation</b> is <b>lea</b>.  This tells the computer what action to
perform, and "lea" says to put a value into a register.  Later we
will see why this instruction is called "lea".</li>
<li>The <b>operands</b> are <b>R2,42[R0]</b>.  R2 is the <i>destination</i>,
where the value will be placed.  The value to be put into
the destination is 42.  For now, ignore the <b>[R0]</b>; its
purpose will be described later.</li>

<li>Everything after the semicolon is a <b>comment</b>.  This
comment is a programming language statement that describes
what the instruction does: it sets the variable R3 to 42.</li>
</ul>

<p>
The name <b>lea</b> is the <b>operation</b>, i.e. the name of the
instruction.  The operand field consists of two operands
separated by a comma.  The first operand, R2, is called the
<b>destination</b>; this is the register where the result will be
placed.  The second operand is a constant 42 followed by
[R0].  When the computer executes this instruction, it simply
places the constant into the destination.  In a higher level
language, we could write <b>R2 := 42</b>.
</p>

<p>
Most instructions follow a similar pattern: the first operand
is the destination where the result is placed, and the
subsequent operands are the arguments to the computation.
This is the same convention used in assignment statements in
many programming languages: the registers in add R1,R2,R3
appear in the same order as the variables in R1 := R2 + R3.
</p>

<p>
All arithmetic operations take place in the registers, and
there is a separate instruction for each operation.  For
example, the following instruction will add the values in R8
and R1 and then put the result into R4:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-Sigma16">    add   R4,R8,R1  ; R4 := R8 + R1
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Notice that the operand field doesn't use operators like :=
or +; those are specified by the operation field (lea, add).
Each instruction performs only one operation.  The operand
field just separates the operands with commas.  The first
operand (R4 in this example) is the <b>destination</b>, which is
where the result will be placed.  The last two operands (R8
and R1) are the values that will be added.
</p>

<p>
To perform a calculation, we need to get the data into
registers (using lea) and then perform the calculation (using
arithmetic instructions).  The following program calculates
3 + 4 and puts the result into R2:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-Sigma16">     lea   R5,3[R0]    ; R5 := 3
     lea   R8,4[R0]    ; R8 := 4
     add   R2,R5,R8    ; R2 := R5 + R8 = 3+4 = 7
</pre>
</div>

<p>
It's a good idea to use comments to explain the meaning of an
instruction.  For now, comments like "R4 := R8 + R1" will be
used to show what the instruction does. That's useful while
learning what the instructions do, but later on we will use
comments to give more meaningful information (for example,
what do the values in the registers mean, and why are we
adding them?).
</p>

<p>
There are three more arithmetic instructions.  These follow
the same pattern as add: in each case, the arithmetic is
performed on the last two registers and the result is placed
in the destination (the first register):
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-Sigma16">     add  R4,R11,R6   ; R4 := R11 + R6
     sub  R5,R2,R13   ; R5 := R2 - R13
     mul  R2,R10,R7   ; R2 := R10 * R7
     div  R5,R6,R12   ; R5 := R6 / R12, R15 := R6 rem R12
</pre>
</div>

<p>
The divide instruction is slightly different: it produces two
results, the quotient and the remainder.  The quotient is
placed in the destination, and the remainder is automatically
placed into R15, even though the instruction doesn't mention
R15.  If you write <b>div R15,R1,R2</b>, the quotient is placed in
R15 and the remainder is discarded.
</p>

<p>
Normally an arithmetic instruction will put a new value into
the destination register, but the operand registers are left
unchanged.  However, what happens if one of the operands is
the same as the destination, for example <b>add R7,R7,R8</b>?
</p>

<p>
An arithmetic instruction proceeds in three phases: (1)
obtain the values in the operand registers; (2) perform the
arithmetic on those values; and (3) put the result into the
destination, discarding whatever value was previously there.
So consider this example:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-Sigma16">    lea   R7,20[R0]  ; R7 := 20
    lea   R8,30[R0]  ; R8 := 30
    add   R7,R7,R8   ; R7 := R7 + R8
</pre>
</div>

<p>
After the two lea instructions have executed, R7 contains 20
and R8 contains 30.  The add instruction does the following:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>It fetches the values in R7 and R8, obtaining 20 and 30</li>
<li>It adds the values, obtaining the result 50</li>
<li>It puts the result 50 into the destination R7, discarding
the previous value.</li>
</ol>

<p>
The final result is that R7 contains 50.
</p>

<p>
Constant data can be specified using either decimal or
hexadecimal notation.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Decimal numbers are written as strings of digits,
optionally preceded by a minus sign: 3,-19, 42.  Leading
zeros are optional, so 23 and 0023 both mean the same
(twenty three).</li>

<li>Hexadecimal numbers are written as four hex digits, and in
assembly language programs they are indicated by putting $
before the number.  Thus $00a5 and 0165 both represent the
integer 165.</li>
</ul>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-Sigma16">     lea   R1,13[R0]     ; R1 =  13 (hex 000d)
     lea   R2,$002f[R0]  ; R2 := 47 (hex 002f)
     lea   R3,$0012[R0]  ; R3 := 18 (hex 0012)
     lea   R4,0012[R0]   ; R4 := 12 (hex 000c)
</pre>
</div>

<p>
The processor page shows numbers as hex without the leading
$, but in an assembly language program the $ is needed to
avoid ambiguity.
</p>

<p>
Sigma uses := as the assignment operator; thus we write R7 :=
R7 + R8 (and we don't write R7 = R7 + R8).  This is because
an assignment statement is profoundly different from an
equation, and mathematicians have long used the = operator to
indicate equations.  It isn't just an academic or theoretical
point; there have been plenty of occasions where computer
programmers get confused between assignment and equality, and
using the wrong operator leads to serious bugs.  (A major
security breach occurred because a C programmer forgot that
in C, = does not mean equals.)
</p>

<p>
Why does assembly language use a notation like add R5,R2,R3
instead of R5 := R2 + R3?  In short, every instruction will
use a similar notation: a keyword for the operation, followed
by the operands separated by commas.  This notation is also
related closely to the way instructions are represented in
memory, which we'll see later.
</p>

<p>
An arithmetic instruction performs just one operation.
Several instructions are needed to evaluate a larger
expression.  In general, you'll need a separate instruction
for every operator that appears in an expression.
</p>

<p>
Example: calculate 6 + 2 * 4 and put the result into R10.  We
have to put the numbers into registers, using lea, and then
perform the arithmetic.  It doesn't matter which registers
are used (as long as we avoid R0 and R15).
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-Sigma16">    lea   R1,6[R0]    ; R1 := 6
    lea   R2,2[R0]    ; R2 := 2
    lea   R3,4[R0]    ; R3 := 4
    mul   R2,R2,R3    ; R2 := R2*R3 = 2*8 = 8
    add   R10,R1,R2   ; R10 := R1+R2 = 6+8 = 14 (hex 000e)
    trap  R0,R0,R0    ; halt
</pre>
</div>

<p>
This is nearly enough to constitute a complete program.  Only
one more thing is needed: a way to terminate the program when
it finishes.  There is a special instruction to do this: a
trap instruction, where the first operand is R0, will stop
the program.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-Sigma16">    trap  R0,R0,R0   ; halt

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-sec-examples">
<p>
You can go to the Editor, and type it in (or copy and paste
it in), but this program is part of the collection of
examples built in to Sigma16.  Here's how to run it:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Go to the <b>Examples</b> page.  Click <b>Examples</b>, then <b>Core</b>,
then <b>Simple</b>.  This brings up a list of small and simple
example programs.  Click <b>ConstArith.asm.txt</b>.  You should
see the listing of the program.  The file name has an
extension <b>.asm.txt</b> that identifies the file as an
assembly language source program.</li>

<li>Click <b>Editor</b>, and you should see the text of the program
in the window.</li>

<li>Go to the <b>Assembler</b> page and click <b>Assemble</b>.</li>

<li>Go to the <b>Processor</b> page.  Click <b>Boot</b>, then <b>Step</b>
repeatedly and watch the effect of each instruction by
observing how the registers are changed.</li>
</ul>

<p>
The Processor page shows numbers in hexadecimal.  The add
instruction puts 14 into R10, and this is displayed as hex
000e.
</p>

<p>
It's a good idea to step through the program slowly, rather
than running it to completion at full speed.  The emulator
will show the next instruction to be executed, highlighted in
blue.  Think about what the instruction should do; in
particular what changes to the registers will occur?  Then
click Step and check to see if the right thing happened.
</p>

<p>
Generally you can use any register you like (apart from R0
and R15), and the choices of registers in the previous
examples are arbitrary.  Registers R1 through R14 behave the
same.  However, two of the registers are different:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>R0</b> contains the constant 0 and it will never change.  Any
time an instruction uses R0, the value it gets will be 0.
It is legal for an instruction to attempt to modify R0 (for
example, add R0,R3,R4 is legal) but after executing this
instruction R0 still contains 0.  The reason for this is
that we frequently need to have access to a register
containing 0.</li>

<li><b>R15</b> is used for two specific purposes.  We have already
seen the first: the divide instruction places the remainder
into R15.  The second purpose is that R15 contains the
<b>condition code</b>, which is a word that contains a number of
bits that provide some information about an instruction.
For example, if an addition produces a result that is too
large to fit in a register, a special flag indicating this
is set in R15.  Several of the instructions, particularly
the arithmetic instructions, change the value of R15 as
well as placing the result in the destination register.
For this reason, R15 cannot be used to hold a variable
since its value would be destroyed almost immediately.</li>
</ul>

<p>
To summarise, Registers R1 through R14 are all identical and
can be used for variables.  R0 contains 0 and will never
change.  R15 changes frequently and can be used to detect
various error conditions and other information about an
instruction.
</p>

<p>
Here is another example:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Suppose we have variables a, b, c, d</li>

<li>And suppose we already have these variables in registers</li>

<li>Choose a register for each variable: R1=a, R2=b, R3=c, R4=d</li>

<li>We wish to compute R5 = (a+b) * (c-d)</li>
</ul>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-Sigma16">     add   R6,R1,R2     ; R6 := a + b
     sub   R7,R3,R4     ; R7 := c - d
     mul   R5,R6,R7     ; R5 := (a+b) * (c-d)

<h3 id="org7cfb3f0"><span class="section-number-3">2.4.</span> Keeping variables in memory</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-4">
<p>
So far we have used registers in the register file to hold
variables.  However, there are only 16 of these, and two have
special purposes (R0 and R15).  That leaves only 14 registers
for general use, and most programs need more than 14
variables.
</p>

<p>
To solve this problem, the computer contains another
subsystem called the <b>memory</b>.  The memory contains a
sequence of <b>memory locations</b>, each of which can hold a word
(16 bits).  Each location is identifed by an <b>address</b>, which
is a natural number \(0, 1, 2, 3, \ldots, 65535\).  The
notation <b>M[a]</b> denotes the value stored in the memory
location with address a.
</p>

<p>
The register file and the memory serve different purposes:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The register file is used to perform calculations.  In
computing something like x := (2*a + 3*b) / (x-1), all the
arithmetic must be done using the register file.  For
example, the instruction add R1,R5,R3 has both operands and
destination in registers, and this is true for all
arithmetic instructions.  The purpose of the registers is
to provide fast access to a small number of variables while
they are needed for calculations.</li>

<li>There are only a few registers available, so we can't keep
all the variables permanently in registers.  The memory is
much larger: it contains 65,536 locations so it can hold
all the variables in a program.  But the memory is slow,
and it has a limitation: there is no instruction that can
do arithmetic on data in the memory.  The purpose of the
memory is to hold large amounts of data for future use.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Normally, a program keeps its variables in memory, so a
variable name refers to a memory location.  The variable name
just stands for the <i>address</i> of the location that contains
the variable.  This allows you to refer to a variable by a
name (x, sum, count) rather than an address (003c, 0104,
00d7).
</p>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-orgf817ece" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="orgf817ece"><span class="section-number-4">2.4.1.</span> load and store</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-2-4-1">
<p>
Since we need a lot of variables, they need to be kept in
memory.  But since we need to do arithmetic, and arithmetic
can be performed only on data in registers, we adopt the
following strategy:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Keep variables permanently in memory.</li>
<li>When you need to do arithmetic on some variables, copy them
from memory to registers.</li>
<li>When finished, copy the results from registers back to
memory.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Two instructions are needed to do this:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>load</b> copies a word from a memory location into a
register.  Suppose <b>xyz</b> is a variable in memory; then to
copy its value into R2 we write <b>load R2,xyz[R0]</b>.</li>

<li><b>store</b> copies a word from a register into a memory
location.  If R3 contains the result of some calculations,
and we want to put it back into memory in a variable named
result, we would write <b>store R3,result[R0]</b>.</li>
</ul>

<p>
At this point we have enough instructions to write an
assignment statement in assembly language.  Typically we will
first write an algorithm using higher level language
notation, and then translate it into instructions.
Translating from a high level language to assembly language
is called "compiling".
</p>

<p>
Example: translate <b>x := a+b+c</b> into assembly language.
</p>

<p>
Solution:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-Sigma16">    load   R1,a[R0]      ; R1 := a
    load   R2,b[R0]      ; R2 := b
    add    R3,R1,R2      ; R3 := a+b
    load   R4,c[R0]      ; R4 := c
    add    R5,R3,R4      ; R5 := (a+b) + c
    store  R5,x[R0]      ; x := a+b+c
</pre>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-orgb598a9b" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="orgb598a9b"><span class="section-number-4">2.4.2.</span> The data statement</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-2-4-2">
<p>
The variables used in a program need to be defined and given
an initial value.  This is done with the <b>data</b> statement.
The variable name comes first, and it must start at the
beginning of the line (no space before it).  Then comes the
keyword <b>data</b>, followed by the initial value, which may be
written in either decimal or hexadecimal.  These pieces of
the statement must be separated by white space.
</p>

<p>
For example, to define variables x, y, z and give them
initial values:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-Sigma16">x    data   34    ; x is a variable with initial value 34
y    data    9    ; y is initially 9
z    data    0    ; z is initially 0
abc  data  $02c6  ; specify initial value as hex
</pre>
</div>

<p>
The data statements should come <b>after</b> all the instructions
in the program.  This may look surprising: in some
programming languages you have to declare your variables at
the beginning, before using them.  There is a good reason why
we will put the instructions first, and the data statements
after; but the reason will come later.
</p>

<p>
Here is a simple example of a complete program that uses
load, store, and data statements, to implement z := x + y.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-Sigma16">; Program Add.  See README in top Sigma16 folder A minimal
; program that adds two integer variables

; Execution starts at location 0, where the first instruction
; will be placed when the program is executed.

      load   R1,x[R0]   ; R1 := x
      load   R2,y[R0]   ; R2 := y
      add    R3,R1,R2   ; R3 := x + y
      store  R3,z[R0]   ; z := x + y
      trap   R0,R0,R0   ; terminate

; Expected result: z = 37 (0025)

; Static variables are placed in memory after the program

x     data  23
y     data  14
z     data   0
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Now you can run the program:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Go to the Examples page.  Click Core, then Simple, then
Add.</li>
<li>Click Editor, and you should see the text of the program in
the window.</li>
<li>Go to the Assembler page.  Click Assemble.</li>
<li>Go to the Processor page.  Click Boot, then Step repeatedly
and watch the effect of each instruction by observing how
the registers and memory are changed.</li>
</ul>

<p>
The processor page shows the contents of the memory.  For
each memory location, the address is shown followed by the
contents of that location.  For example, if a line in the
memory display shows 00b7 4c3f, this means that the memory
location with address 00b7 contains 4c3f.  This is written as
M[00b7] = 4c3f.
</p>

<p>
Memory addresses and contents, as well as register contents,
are shown in hexadecimal with no leading $.  Since all these
numbers are hexadecimal, putting $ in front (or 0x as in C)
just adds distraction without telling you anything useful.
</p>

<p>
The processor displays two independent views into the memory.
This is convenient because it's frequently necessary to look
at two different portions of the memory at the same time.
For example, it's helpful to look at the machine language
code in one view and the data in the other view.  With
programs that use advanced techniques (e.g. pointers and
activation records) it's essential to be able to view two
different areas of memory.  Despite the two views, there is
just one memory.

The register file and the memory are similar in many ways,

<p>
Why does the computer have both registers and memory?  After
all, this makes programming a little more complicated.  You
have to keep track of which variables are currently in
registers, and you have to use load and store instructions to
copy data between the registers and memory.  Wouldn't it be
easier just to get rid of the distinction between registers
and memory, and do all the arithmetic on memory?
</p>

<p>
Yes, this would be simpler, and there have been real
computers like that.  However, this approach makes the
computer slower.  With modern circuits, a computer without
load and store instructions (where you do arithmetic on
memory locations) would run approximately 100 times slower.
So nearly all modern computers do arithmetic in registers,
and use instructions like load and store to copy data back
and forth between registers and memory.

<h3 id="org5028173"><span class="section-number-3">2.5.</span> Assembly language</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-5">
<p>
The programs we have seen so far are written in <b>assembly
language</b>.  The machine itself executes programs in <b>machine
language</b>, which is covered later.  Assembly language is
translated to machine language by a program called an
<b>assembler</b>.
</p>

<p>
The purpose of assembly language is to give the programmer
absolute control over the machine language program without
having to remember lots of numeric addresses and codes.
Assembly language is readable for humans, while machine
language is executable by machines.  For example, it is
easier to remember the name "mul" for multiply than to
remember the machine language code (which happens to be 3).
Similarly, it's easier to remember the names of variables (x,
y, sum, total) than the numeric addresses of the memory
locations that hold these variables.
</p>

<p>
The syntax of assembly language is simple and rigid.  Every
statement must fit on one line of source code; you cannot
have a statement that spans several lines, and you cannot
have several statements on one line.
</p>

<p>
Sigma16 assembly language uses a small set of characters.
Any character not on this list will generate an error
message.  A Sigma16 program can <b>manipulate</b> any 16-bit
character, but the source assembly language code is
restricted to this source character set.  There are many
characters that look similar but are actually distinct.  For
example, the minus sign, the hyphen, the en-dash, and the
em-dash all look similar &#x2013; you have to look closely to see
the difference &#x2013; but Sigma16 assembly language uses the
minus sign, and the hyphens and dashes won't work.
</p>

<p>
These are the legal characters in an assembly language
program:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>letters
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>_abcdefghijk</li>
<li>lmnopqrstuvwxyz</li>
<li>ABCDEFGHIJKLMN</li>
<li>OPQRSTUVWXYZ</li>
</ul></li>
<li>digits: 0123456789</li>
<li>separators: space tab ,;</li>
<li>quotes: " '</li>
<li>punctuation: ".$[]()+-*</li>
<li>other: ?&lt;=&gt;!%^&amp;{}#~@:|/\'</li>
</ul>

<p>
Word processors often substitute characters.  For example,
when you type a minus sign in a paragraph of English text,
word processors may replace the minus sign with a hyphen or
dash, which is correct for typeset English but incorrect for
assembly language.  The Sigma16 editor will insert the
correct characters, as will plain text editors.
</p>

<p>
Each statement has a rigid format that consists of up to four
<b>fields</b>.  The fields must be separated by one or more
spaces, and a field cannot contain a space.  Every field is
optional, but if a field is missing then the following fields
must also be missing, except for an optional comment.  The
fields are:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>label (optional) &#x2013; If present, the label must begin in the
first character of the line.  If a line starts with a
space, then there is no label field.  A label has the same
syntax as names or identifiers in many languages: it may
contain letters, digits, underscores, and must begin with a
letter.  Both upper and lower case letters are allowed, and
the syntax is case sensitive (Loop and LOOP and loop are
three different labels).</li>

<li>mnemonic &#x2013; This is the name of the operation: load, lea,
add, sub, etc.  The mnemonic must be preceded by white
space, and it must be the name of a valid instruction or
assembler directive.</li>

<li>operands field &#x2013; the operands required by the type of
statement.  There are several formats possible for the
operands field, depending on the instruction; these are
detailed later.  For example, for the add instruction the
operand field must consist of three registers, separated by
commas (e.g. R1,R2,R3).  Spaces are not allowed in the
operands field: R1,R2,R3 is fine but R1, R2, R3 is an
error.</li>

<li>comments &#x2013; anything that follows the operands field, or
anything that appears after a semicolon, is a comment.  The
semicolon is not required if the mnemonic and operands
fields are present, but it is good practice to include it.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Here are some syntactically valid statements:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-Sigma16">loop   load   R1,count[R0]    ; R1 := count
       add    R1,R1,R2        ; R1 := R1 + 1
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Each of the following statements is wrong!
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-Sigma16">   add   R2, R8, R9    ; spaces in the operand field
loop1  store x[R0],R5  ; wrong order: should be R5,x[R0]
    addemup            ; invalid mnemonic
 loop2  load R1,x[R0]  ; Space before the label
</pre>
</div>

<p>
If you forget some detail, look at one of the example
programs.
</p>

<p>
When the assembler is translating a program, it begins by
looking at the spaces in order to split each statement into
the four fields.  This happens before it looks at the
operation and operands.  The assembly listing uses colors to
indicate the different fields.  If you get a syntax error
message, the first thing to check is that the fields are what
you intended.  For example if you meant to say
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-Sigma16">     add R1,R2,R3  ; x := a + b
</pre>
</div>

<p>
but you have a spurious space, like this
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-Sigma16">     add R1, R2,R3  ; x := a + b
</pre>
</div>

<p>
the assembler will decide that the mnemonic is add, the
operands field is "R1," and all the rest - "R2,R3 ; x := a +
b" &#x2013; is a comment, and the colors of the text in the
assembly listing will show this clearly.
</p>

<p>
The rules above mean that a label must begin in the first
character of a line, and also that if any non-space character
appears at the beginning, it is taken to be a label.  The
following statement has a label "add", an operation
"R1,R2,R3" (and of course there is no such instruction), and
the operand field is ";".  Again, the syntax highlighting
will show the error clearly.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-Sigma16">add R1,R2,R3  ; x := a + b
</pre>
</div>

<p>
In assembly language, you can write constants in either
decimal or hexadecimal.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>decimal:   50 -39</li>
<li>hexadecimal: $003b</li>
</ul>

<p>
Examples:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-Sigma16">    lea   R1,40[R0]      ; R1 = 40
    lea   R2,$ffff[R0]   ; R2 = -1

x   data  25
y   data  $2c9e
</pre>
</div>

<p>
There are two instruction formats in the Core architecture,
which differ in the form of the operands:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>RRR</b> instructions have an operand field containing three
registers separated by commas.  Example: <b>add R8,R13,R6</b>.</li>

<li><b>RX</b> instructions have an operand field that specifies a
register and an address.  The address is a name or
constant, followed by a register. Examples: <b>load
R12,array[R6]</b> and <b>lea R5,23[R0]</b>.</li>
</ul>

<p>
It isn't enough just to get the assembler to accept your
program without error messages.  Your program should be clear
and easy to read.  This requires good style.  Good style
saves time writing the program and getting it to work, while
aA sloppy program looks unprofessional and makes testing and
debugging harder.  Here are a few tips.
</p>

<p>
<b>Write good comments.</b> You should include good comments in
all programs, regardless of language.  Comments are
especially important in assembly language, because the code
tends to need more explanation.  At the beginning of the
program, use comments to identify the program and author and
to say what it does.  Use full line comments to describe in
general what's going on, and put a comment on every
instruction to explain what it's doing.
</p>

<p>
<b>Indent your code consistently.</b> Each field should be lined
up vertically, like this:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-Sigma16">     load   R1,three[R0]  ; R1 = 3
     load   R2,x[R0]      ; R2 = x
     mul    R3,R1,R2      ; R3 = 3*x
     store  R3,y[R0]      ; y = 3*x
     trap   R0,R0,R0      ; stop the program
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Not haphazard like this:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-Sigma16">   load   R1,three[R0]     ; R1 = 3
 load  R2,x[R0] ; R2 = x
      mul R3,R1,R2           ; R3 = 3*x
store         R3,y[R0]      ; y = 3*x
  trap  R0,R0,R0      ; stop the program
</pre>
</div>

<p>
The exact number of spaces each field is indented isn't
important; what's important is to make the program neat and
readable.
</p>

<p>
<b>Spaces, not tabs.</b> To indent your code, always use spaces &#x2013;
avoid tabs.  In general, never use tabs except in the (rare)
cases they are required (for example in makefiles).  The tab
character was introduced long ago into computer character
sets to try to mimic the tab key on old mechanical
typewriters.  Unfortunately, software does not handle tab
characters consistently.  If you use tabs, your program can
look good in one application and like a mess in another.
It's easy to indent with spaces, and it works everywhere.
</p>

<p>
Some programming languages use indentation to indicate
program structure.  If some of that indentation is done with
tabs, it could work on one computer but give syntax errors on
another system.  Even worse, it could compile but give
different results as the program structure has changed.
(Wrong results are worse than error messages.)

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-6">
<p>
To run an assembly language program, you first need to put it
into the editor window.  Then you can go to the Assembler
page, assemble it and run it on the Processor page.  There
are several ways to enter a program into the editor window.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>Starter program.</b> Editor tab. Click Hello World.  This
will load a small fixed example program into the editor
buffer.</li>
<li><b>Collection of examples.</b> Examples tab.  The Sigma15 app
provides a collection of example programs.  Click Core to
see the examples that use only the core instruction set.
Click Simple, then ConstArith.  Go to the Editor tab and
the example you selected will be in the window.  All of
these example programs are in the Sigma16 system, not on
your local computer.</li>
<li><b>Type it in.</b> Editor tab. Type in a program.  If there was
already some text there, click New.</li>
<li><b>Read from a file.</b> Editor tab. Click Open File.  This
brings up a file chooser dialog where you can traverse the
file system on your computer and select a file.</li>
<li><b>Copy from file and paste.</b> If your program is visible in
another window on your computer, you can copy its text,
then go to the Sigma16 editor, and paste.  Normally it's
better to use Open File, but if your browser has disabled
file access the copy-paste method is ok.</li>
</ul>

<p>
You can edit the text in the Editor window:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Click the arrow keys or the left mouse button to move the
cursor.</li>
<li>Click left mouse button and drag to select text.</li>
<li>Click right mouse button and select Cut, Copy, Paste,
Undo.</li>
</ul>

<p>
<b>Save your work.</b> After typing in a program, or editing it,
you should save it to a file.  Click Save As.  This brings up
a dialog where you can traverse your file system and provide
a file name (which should end in .asm.txt).
</p>

<p>
If you leave the browser without saving the text in the
editor window to a file, that text will be lost, so it's
important to save your work regularly.  If you don't do that,
sooner or later the system will crash and you'll lose your
data.  When you close a browser tab that's running Sigma16,
the browser may put up a message warning you that "Changes
you made may not be saved".  The browser can't tell whether
the editor text needs to be saved.
</p>

<p>
The Sigma16 app will know what file is associated with your
program if you have read it from a file (Editor: Open File)
or if you have saved it to a specific location in your
computer (Editor: Save As).
</p>

<p>
Once the app knows which file contains your program, you can
edit it and save it again just by clicking Editor: Save.
This is easier than Save As because you don't need to
traverse the file system again.
</p>

<p>
You can also edit your assembly language program using an
external text editor, rather than the simple editor in the
Sigma16 app.  If you have modified the file using an external
editor, click Editor: Refresh to reload the file from your
disk.
</p>

<p>
If you do use an external text editor, use a real text editor
(emacs, vim, notepad++, or whatever you prefer), not a word
processor.  Word processors embed extra formatting data into
the file, and the assembler can't handle that.  Furthermore,
word processors often change the characters you type.  For
example, they may change the minus character (-) into an
en-dash.  There are four different characters that look
similar to a minus sign (minus, hyphen, en-dash, em-dash) and
the assembly language only accepts the minus sign.  If you
get bad characters, the assembler will give an error message.

<div id="outline-container-orgc5d976f" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgc5d976f"><span class="section-number-3">2.7.</span> Jumps and conditionals</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-7">
<p>
Conditionals allow a program to decide which statements to
execute based on Boolean expressions.  One example is the
if-then statement, for example:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-Sigma16">if x&lt;y
  then statement 1
statement 2
</pre>
</div>

<p>
A related form is the if-then-else statement:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-Sigma16">if x&lt;y
  then statement 1
  else statement 2
statement 3
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Most high level control constructs can be translated into
code that contains just one form of conditional, the
<b>conditional goto</b>.  This uses a Boolean expression <i>bexp</i> to
decide whether to jump to <i>someLabel</i>, or not to jump:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-Sigma16">if bexp then goto someLabel
</pre>
</div>

<p>
The commonest case is where <i>bexp</i> is a comparision between
two integers:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-Sigma16">if x &lt; y then goto someLabel
</pre>
</div>

<p>
This statement is implemented in assembly language in two
steps:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>First, a <b>comparison</b> instruction is used to produce a
Boolean result, which is placed in the <i>condition code</i>
(which is in R15).</li>

<li>Second, a <b>conditional jump</b> instruction will either jump
or not jump, depending on the condition code.  This allows
a choice of what instruction to execute next.</li>
</ol>

<p>
The cmp instruction compares the integers in two registers,
and it sets R15 to the result of the comparison.  R15 is a
special register because several instructions, including cmp,
use it automatically without specifying R15 in the
instruction.  Reflecting its special status, R15 also has a
name: it's called the <i>condition code</i>.
</p>

<p>
Any relational operation can be used; it isn't limited to
less-than.  You can think of the condition code as holding a
result like "less than", or "equal", etc.  The way these
comparison results are represented will be covered later.
</p>

<p>
After setting the condition code with cmp, the program
executes a conditional jump.  The instruction jumplt
someLabel[R0] will go to the instruction with the specified
label if and only if the condition code indicates "less than"
(lt).
</p>

<p>
Here is a high level language statement:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-Sigma16">if x &lt; y then goto someLabel
</pre>
</div>

<p>
To implement this in assembly language, we use a cmp
instruction followed by jumplt:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-Sigma16">    load   R2,x[R0]       ; R2 := x
    load   R3,y[R0]       ; R3 := y
    cmp    R2,R3          ; compare x and y
    jumplt someLabel[R0]  ; if x &lt; y then goto someLabel
    xxx                   ; this executes if x &gt;= y
    xxx
    xxx
someLabel
    xxx                  ; this executes if x &lt; y
</pre>
</div>

<p>
The conditional jump instructions have the form jumpXX, where
XX is a relation, such as lt, eq, and so on:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-Sigma16">jumplt  someLabel[R0]  ; if &lt;  then goto someLabel
jumple  someLabel[R0]  ; if &lt;= then goto someLabel
jumpeq  someLabel[R0]  ; if =  then goto someLabel
jumpne  someLabel[R0]  ; if != then goto someLabel
jumpge  someLabel[R0]  ; if &gt;= then goto someLabel
jumpgt  someLabel[R0]  ; if &gt;  then goto someLabel
</pre>
</div>

<p>
These conditional jumps treat the contents of the registers
as integers represented in two's complement notation.  This
means, for example, that $ffff is less than 0, because $ffff
represents -1.  There are several more conditional jumps that
you can use for comparing natural numbers (binary), and a few
other things as well.
</p>

<p>
A compare instruction is often followed immediately by a
conditional jump, as in the example above.  You can also save
the result of a comparison in a Boolean variable and perform
logic on Boolean variables.  The Boolean variables can later
be used to control conditional jumps.  This topic will be
discussed later, as it involves instructions from the full
standard instruction set.
</p>

<p>
The address in a jump instruction &#x2013; the place to jump to &#x2013;
is normally specified as a label which is defined in the
label field of some instruction.  You can place a label in
the same line as the instruction, or it can be on a line with
nothing else, in which case the label refers to the next
instruction.  In the following code, label1 is the address of
the add instruction and label 2 is the address of the sub
instruction.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-Sigma16">label1   add  R2,R4,R13
label2
         sub  R15,R0,R1
</pre>
</div>

<p>
If-then constructs are translated into assembly language
following two similar fixed patterns.  Suppose Bexp is a
Boolean in any register Rd
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-Sigma16">if bexp
  then statement 1
statement 2
</pre>
</div>

<p>
This is translated according to the following pattern:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-Sigma16">     if !bexp then goto L2
     statement 1
L2:
     statement 2
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Here is an example:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-Sigma16">a := 93
x := 35
y := 71
if y &gt; x then a := 59
b := 104
</pre>
</div>

<p>
The corresponding assembly language is:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-Sigma16">; a := 93
      lea     R1,93[R0]    ; R1 := 93
      store   R1,a[R0]     ; a := 93

; x := 35
      lea     R1,35[R0]    ; R1 := 35
      store   R1,x[R0]     ; x := 35

; y := 71
      lea     R1,71[R0]    ; R1 := 71
      store   R1,x[R0]     ; x := 71

; if y &gt; x
      load    R1,y[R0]     ; R1 := y
      load    R2,x[R0]     ; R2 := x
      cmp     R1,R2        ; compare y with x
      jumple  R3,skip[R0]  ; if not y &gt; x then goto skip

;  then a := 59
      lea    R1,59[R0]     ; R1 := 59
      store  R1,a[R0]      ; a := 59

; b := 104
skip  lea    R1,104[R0]    ; R1 := 104
      store  R1,b[R0]      ; b := 104
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Notice the use of jumple: if the Boolean expression (y&gt;x) is
False we want to skip over the "then" part, so we want to
jump if y &lt;= x (hence jumple).
</p>

<p>
An if-then-else statement has a similar compilation pattern,
but this time there are two separate parts: the "then-part"
and the "else-part".  Depending on the value of the Boolean
expression, one of those parts should be executed and the
other should be skipped over.
</p>

<p>
For if-then-else, and many other control constructs, we need
an <b>unconditional jump</b> which will always go to the specified
address, and which doesn't use a Boolean.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-Sigma16">jump   somewhere[R0]    ; go to somewhere
</pre>
</div>

<p>
The general form of an if-then-else is
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-Sigma16">if x &lt; y
  then S1
  else S2
S3  
</pre>
</div>

<p>
The general if-then-else construct can be translated to use
just goto and conditional goto:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-Sigma16">    if x &gt;= y then goto L2
    S1
    goto L3
L2: S2
L3: S3
</pre>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-org0436aca" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org0436aca"><span class="section-number-3">2.8.</span> Loops</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-8">
<p>
Loops are implemented using compilation patterns based on
comparisons and jumps.  The fundamental form is the <b>while
loop</b>.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-Sigma16">while Bexp do S1
S2
</pre>
</div>

<p>
The compilation pattern is:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-Sigma16">L1   if not Bexp then goto L2
     S2
     goto L1
L2
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Occasionally you may encounter an infinite loop, which is
sometimes expressed as a while loop:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-Sigma16">while true do S1
</pre>
</div>

<p>
This doesn't need a Boolean expression; it is simply compiled
into:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-Sigma16">loop
   instructions for S1
   jump   loop[R0] 
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Infinite loops are rather rare, or at least they should be.
On occasion they are exactly what is wanted.  For example,
operating systems contain a loop that looks for something
useful to do, and then does it, and this should be an
infinite loop.
</p>

<p>
However, there is a common but poor programming style that
uses infinite loops with random break or goto statements to
get out of the loop.  This may be appropriate on occasion but
generally it is bad style.
</p>

<p>
So far we have seen several compilation patterns:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>if-then</li>
<li>if-then-else</li>
<li>while</li>
</ul>

<p>
Every high level programming construct has a compilation
pattern, and they are mostly built using comparisons and
jumps.  In principle, these patterns are straightforward to
use.  However, there are two issues that require a little
care: uniqueness of labels and nested statements.
</p>

<p>
Labels must be unique: the same one cannot be used twice in
the same program, and if it is, the assembler will give an
error message.  This means that you cannot follow the
compilation patterns blindly.  If you use "loop" as the label
for a while loop, as in the pattern above, you need a
different label for your next while loop.
</p>

<p>
The best approach here is not to use labels like loop, loop1,
loop2.  It's far better to think about the <b>purpose</b> of the
construct in your program and to use a label that reflects
this purpose.
</p>

<p>
Another complication is that most programs contain <b>nested
statements</b>.  These are statements that contain smaller
statements, and the containment may go several levels deep.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-Sigma16">if b1
  then S1
       if b2 then S2 else S3
       S4
  else S5;
       while b3 do S6
S7
</pre>
</div>

<p>
There is an important principle to follow here: every time a
statement appears in a compilation pattern (we have been
calling them S1, S2, S3, etc.), it should be translated as a
<b>block</b>.
</p>

<p>
A block is a sequence of instructions which <b>always</b> begins
execution at the first instruction, and <b>always</b> finishes at
the end.  You <b>never</b> jump into the middle of it, and it
<b>never</b> jumps out of the middle to some other place.
</p>

<p>
Every statement should be compiled into a block of code.
This block may contain internal structure &#x2014; it may contain
several smaller blocks &#x2014; but to execute it you should
always begin at the beginning and it should always finish at
the end.
</p>

<p>
In programming language theory, programming with blocks is
often considered to be good practice or good style.  But it
is more than just an issue of style.  If you always treat the
statements inside compilation patterns as blocks, the
patterns will "just work", no matter how deeply nested they
are.  If you violate the block structure, you will find it
difficult to get the program to work.

<h3 id="orga720deb"><span class="section-number-3">2.9.</span> Machine language</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-9">
<p>
The bits representing an instruction (written in hex) (e.g
0d69) are <b>machine language</b>.  The hardware runs the machine
language &#x2014; it's just looking at the numbers.  The text
notation with names &#x2013; e.g. add R13,R6,R9 &#x2013; is called
<b>assembly language</b>.  Assembly language is for humans to read
and write; machine language is for machines to execute.  Both
languages specify the program in complete detail, down to the
last bit.
</p>

<p>
As a program is running, the memory contains all your
program's data: the variables, data structures, arrays,
lists, etc.  <b>The memory also contains the machine language
program itself.</b> The program is stored inside the computer's
main memory, along with the data.  This concept is called
<b>the stored program computer</b>.
</p>

<p>
There is an alternative approach: a computer can be designed
to have one memory to hold the data, and a completely
separate memory to hold the program.  This approach is often
used for special-purpose computers (primarily
micro-controllers), but experience has shown this to be
inferior for general purpose computers.
</p>

<p>
Sigma16 has several different kinds of instruction.  These
are called <i>instruction formats</i>.  All the instructions with
the same format have similar representations in machine
language.  The Sigma16 Core has two instruction formats:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>RRR instructions use the registers</li>
<li>RX instructions use the memory</li>
</ul>

<p>
The machine language program is in the memory.  Therefore we
need to represent each instruction as a word that can be
stored in memory.  An instruction format is a systematic way
to represent an instruction using one or more words (a word
is a string of bits).
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>An RRR instruction is represented in one word</li>
<li>An RX instruction is represented in two words.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-orgcdcd5eb" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="orgcdcd5eb"><span class="section-number-4">2.9.1.</span> RRR instructions</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-2-9-1">
<p>
Every RRR instruction is represented in one word (16 bits),
which is organised as four 4-bit fields.  When describing a
machine word, we normally write each field value as a
hexadecimal digit: one of 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, a, b,
c, d, e, f.  These correspond to 0, 1, &#x2026;, 15 in decimal.
</p>

<p>
The machine language code needs to specify which RRR
instruction this is.  Is it add? sub?  mul? another?  This is
done with an operation code &#x2014; a number that says what the
operation is.  There are about a dozen RRR instructions, so a
4-bit operation code suffices.  For example, the add
instruction has an opcode of 0.
</p>

<p>
We also need to specify three registers: destination and two
source operands.  There are 16 registers, so a specific one
can be specified by 4 bits.  Thus the requirements for an RRR
instruction are 4 fields, each containing 4 bits, for a total
of 16 bits, so an RRR instruction exactly fills one word.
</p>

<p>
The four fields in an RRR instruction are named:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>op &#x2013; Operation code (e.g. add, sub, etc.)  This is a
number that specifies which instruction it is.</li>
<li>d &#x2013; Destination register</li>
<li>a &#x2013; First source operand register</li>
<li>b &#x2013; Second source operand register</li>
</ul>

<p>
Here are the operation codes for the RRR instructions we have
seen so far.  There are a few more RRR instructions, but they
all have the same form as these do.

<p>
Don't memorise this table: you just need to understand how
it's used.  For example, let's translate this assembly
language statement into machine language:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-Sigma16">    mul  R14,R6,R10
</pre>
</div>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>mul is an RRR instruction, so we need to find the values
of the four fields: op, d, a, b.</li>
<li>The table above says that the opcode for mul is $2 (that's
0010 as a bit string).</li>
<li>The destination is R14, so the d field is $e.</li>
<li>The first operand is R6, so the a field is $6.</li>
<li>The last operand is R10, so the b field is $a.</li>
<li>Putting the fields together ("assembling them into an
instruction"), we get the machine language instruction:
$2e6a.</li>
</ol>

<p>
Every RRR instruction is assembled the same way.  The numbers
in the fields will be different, but the procedure is always
exactly the same.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-org453e45b" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org453e45b"><span class="section-number-4">2.9.2.</span> RX instructions</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-2-9-2">
<p>
We have seen several RX instructions so far:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-Sigma16">    lea    R5,19[R0]   ; R5 = 19
    load   R1,x[R0]    ; R1 = x
    store  R3,z[R0]    ; z = R3
</pre>
</div>

<p>
An RX instruction contains two operands, separated by a
comma.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The first operand is a register, and it's called the
"register operand" (e.g. R5)</li>
<li>The second operand is a constant or label followed by a
register (e.g. 19[R0] or x[R0]).  This is called the
"address operand", and it contains two parts:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The first part is either a constant like 19, or a label
like x.  This part is called the "displacement", and its
value is one word.  If this part is a constant (e.g. 19)
then the value of the displacement is simply the value of
the constant.  If it's a label like x, the value is the
address in memory of x.</li>
<li>The seocnd part is a register in square brackets,
e.g. [R0].  This is called the "index register".  In the
examples we've seen so far, the index register has always
been R0, but in general it can be any register, and this
is useful for several purposes we'll see later.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>
For RRR instructions, the op field contains a number saying
which RRR instruction it is.  This is the primary opcode.
For RX instructions, the op field always contains f.  So how
does the machine know which RX instruction it is?  This is
specified by a secondary code in the b field.  Here are the
full codes (op and b) for a few of the RX instructions:

<p>
Consider this assembly language statement:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-Sigma16">     lea   R2,38[R7]
</pre>
</div>

<p>
There are two words in the machine language code.  The first
word has the same 4 fields as for RRR instructions: op, d, a,
b, where
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>op contains $f for every RX instruction</li>
<li>d contains the register operand (in the example, $2)</li>
<li>a contains the index register (in the example, $7)</li>
<li>b contains a code indicating which RX instruction this is
(1 means load).  This "secondary opcode" is required
because the op field just indicates that the instruction is
RX format, but doesn't say which RX instruction it is.</li>
</ul>

<p>
The second word contains the <b>displacement</b>.  In the example,
this is 38 (or $0026).
</p>

<p>
If the address field of an instruction has a label (like x)
rather than a constant (lik 204), we need to know the value
of the label in order to assemble the instruction.  If x is a
variable, the value of the label x is the address of the
variable in memory.  If x is a label on an instruction, its
value is the address of the instruction.
</p>

<p>
Example: translate load R7,x[R12] from assembly language to
machine language, given that the address of x is $0c3a.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>First word:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>op = $f (indicates that this is an RX instruction, but
not which one; that needs the b field)</li>
<li>d = $7 (the register operand)</li>
<li>a = $c (part of the address operand: the register [R12])</li>
<li>b = $1 (this is the secondary opcode, which indicates
that this RX instruction is load)</li>
<li>The first word is $f701</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Second word:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The displacement, part of the address operand, is $0c3a</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The complete machine language instruction: $f7c1 $0c3a</li>
</ul>

<p>
The instruction jump loop[R0] has only one operand in
assembly language, which is loop[R0].  This looks like an
exception: the other RX instructions have two operands.
However, the machine language representation of jump also
contains a register operand, just like all RX instructions,
but the machine ignores that register when the program runs,
and the assembler just sets it to R0 in the machine code.
This is called a "don't care" operand.

"pseudoinstructions".  They are just a convenient assembly

in machine language using just two real instructions: jumpc0

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-10">
<p>
Consider "Program Strange" below.  You can find the program
on the Examples page (go to the Core/Instructions section),
or you can copy it from below and paste it into the Editor
page.
</p>

<p>
This program doesn't compute anything particularly useful.
It's rather strange and not a model for good programming
style, but it illustrates an extremely important concept,
which is discussed in the solution below.
</p>

<p>
The program has a variable y which is defined in the last
line: y data 0.  But you can edit that line to give y any
initial value; it doesn't need to be 0.
</p>

<p>
The aim of this tutorial is to figure out what the program
does, and to do so for several specific values of y.  A
solution is given below, but please try first to work it out
for yourself.
</p>
</div>

<h4 id="org20a75ee"><span class="section-number-4">2.10.1.</span> The problem</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-2-10-1">
<p>
Run the program with several different initial values of the
variable y.  These values are given below.  For each run,
assume that all the registers contain 0 after the program is
booted, before it begins execution.  For each value of y, do
the following:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Edit the last statement of the program to give y the
specified value.</li>
<li>Execute the program manually, with paper and pencil but
without the computer.  Give the final values of the
registers.  Think about what is going on as the program
runs.</li>
<li>Assemble the program and boot it in the processor.  Run
the program on the emulator and check whether your
execution was correct.  Be sure to single-step through the
program.  Before executing an instruction, think about
what it will do.  Then click Step and look at the
registers to see if you were right.</li>
</ol>

<p>
Here are the different variations:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Run the program in its original form, with <b>y data 0</b></li>
<li>Change the last line to <b>y data 1</b> and run it again</li>

<p>
It's best to try answering the questions on your own first,
and then to check by running the program on the emulator,
before reading the solution!
</p>

<p>
The program loads an <b>instruction</b> into a register, does
arithmetic on it by adding <b>y</b> to it, and stores the result
back into memory.  This phenomenon is called <b>self-modifying
code</b>, and it exploits the fact that instructions and data
are held in the same memory (this is the <b>stored program
computer</b> concept).  The original instruction is <b>add
R5,R3,R3</b>, and its machine language code is 0533.
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>When y=0, the final values are: R1=0, R2=0533, R3=3, R4=4,
R5=6.  The only notable points are that the store
instruction doesn't actually change the value of the word
in memory (it was 0533 and 0533 is being stored there),
and the last add instruction doesn't change the value in
R0 because R0 can never change; it is always 0.  (Of
course if R7=0 then the result of the addition is 0
anyway.)</li>

<li>When y=1, the final values are: R1=1, R2=0534, R3=3, R4=4,
R5=7.  Note that R5 is <b>not</b> 3+3=6.  When y=1 is added to
the instruction, the result is 0534 which means <b>add
R5,R3,R4</b>, so instead of adding R3+R3 it adds R3+R4.</li>

<li>When y=256, the final values are: R1=256=0100, R2=0633,
R3=3, R4=4, R5=0, R6=6. The decimal number 256 is 0100 in
hexadecimal.  When this is added to the instruction, the
result is 0633, which means <b>add R6,R3,R3</b> so R3+R3 is
loaded into R6, not into R5.</li>

<li>When y=8192, the final values are: R1=4096=2000, R2=2533,
R3=3, R4=4, R5=9.  The decimal number 8192 is 2000 in
hexadecimal, and when this is added to the instruction the
result is 2533, which means <b>mul R5,R3,R3</b>.  It's no
longer an <b>add</b> instruction, it's a <b>multiply</b> instruction
that calculates R5 := R3*R3 = 9.</li>

<li>When y=-5424 the program goes into an infinite
loop. R1=ead0 (the hexadecimal representation of -5424),
R2=f003, R3=3, and R4=4.  What started out as the <b>add</b>
instruction at x has been transformed into <b>jump 7[R0]</b>,
comprising the word at <b>x</b> (f003) and the following word
(which is 0007).  This jump instruction goes back to the
first lea instruction, and the program runs for ever (lea,
lea, jump).</li>
</ol>

<p>
There is a lot to say about the phenomenon of self-modifying
code.
</p>

<p>
This program shows clearly that a computer does not execute
assembly language; it executes machine language.  Try running
it on the Sigma16 application (single step each instruction).
You'll see that the assembly language statement <b>add
R5,R3,R3</b> is highlighted in red, but that is just the GUI
trying to be helpful.  What's important is that the machine
language instruction is fetched from memory and loaded into
ir (the instruction register), and that is not 0533.  The
machine decodes the contents of ir and does whatever that
says to do; it isn't aware of the assembly language
statement.  Indeed, a machine doesn't even understand the
concept of assembly language &#x2014; everything is just bits!
</p>

<p>
To follow exactly what is happening in the emulator, it's
important to look at the pc and ir registers.  These reflect
what the machine is doing.  The assembly language does not.
</p>

<p>
What is self-modifying code good for?  The answer lies in the
early history of electronic computers.  Early computers (late
1940s and early 1950s) did not use an effective address (i.e.
displacement + index) like Sigma16; the instructions simply
specified the absolute memory address of an operand.  This is
ok for simple variables, but how could they process arrays?
</p>

<p>
The solution was to use self modifying code.  In a loop that
traverses an array, there would be a load instruction using
address 0.  In the body of the loop, there would be
instructions to calculate the address of x[i] by loading the
address of x and adding i; this is then stored into the
address field of the load instruction.  That instruction is
then executed, obtaining the value of x[i].  This technique
became obsolete in the early 1950s with the invention of
index registers and effective addresses.
</p>

<p>
The pioneers of computers considered the concept of the
<b>stored program computer</b> (i.e. the program and data are in
the same memory) to be fundamental and essential.  One of the
most important reasons was that it made arrays possible.  Now
we consider the stored program concept to be fundamental <b>for
different reasons</b>.
</p>

<p>
Self modifying code is tricky, and difficult to debug.  It
makes programs hard to read: you can't rely on what the
program says, but on what its instructions will become in the
future.  For these reasons, self modifying code is now
considered to be bad programming practice.
</p>

<p>
If a program modifies itself, you can't have one copy of the
program in memory and allow it to be shared by several users.
For example, it's common now to have a web browser open with
several tabs.  Each tab is served by an independent process
(a separate running instance of a program that updates the
window showing the web page).  If you have 5 tabs open, there
are 5 processes, each running the same machine language code,
and there's only one copy of that in memory.  This wouldn't
work if the program modified itself!
</p>

<p>
Self modifying code leads to security holes: if a hacker has
the ability to change your machine language code in memory,
they could make your own program act against you.
</p>

<p>
Modern computers use a technique called <b>segmentation</b> that
prevents a program from modifying itself.  This leads to
increased reliability and security.
</p>

<p>
<a id="org2b7056c"></a>
Some computers have a facility that allows you to gain the
power of self modifying code without actually modifying the
code in memory.  The idea is to have an instruction <b>execute
R1,x[R0]</b> which calculates the logical or of the two operands
and then executes the result; x is the address of an
instruction and R1 contains the modification to it.  The
modified instruction is executed, but there is no change to
the machine code in memory.  This idea was used in the IBM
360 and its successors.  However, as the design of effective
addresses has become more sophisticated, the execute
instruction is rarely needed, and most modern computers don't
provide it.

<h3 id="org7aac110"><span class="section-number-3">2.11.</span> Breakpoints</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-11">
<p>
When you are testing or debugging a program, you may need to
execute many instructions before reaching the point you're
interested in.  Some programs execute thousands of
instructions just to initialize.  It's infeasible to step
through all those instructions, yet if you just run at full
speed you won't be able to see what's happening in the
section you are working on.
</p>

<p>
The solution is to run the program at full speed but to force
it to stop when it reaches a specific instruction.  This is
called a <i>breakpoint</i>.  When the program stops at the
breakpoint, you can examine the registers and memory, and
step through instructions from that point.  At any time you
can click Run and full speed execution resumes, until either
another breakpoint is encountered or the program terminates.
</p>

<p>
Both a breakpoint and a halt instruction (trap R0,R0,R0) will
stop execution of the program.  The difference is that after
a breakpoint you can click Step or Run to continue, but after
halt the program cannot execute any more instructions until
you boot the processor again.
</p>

<p>
There are two ways to set a breakpoint:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><i>Trap break</i>: Insert an instruction into the program that
breaks execution at that point.</li>
<li><i>External break</i>: Define a breakpoint in the user
interface, without modifying the program.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Both forms are useful.  Most of the time, while debugging a
program, a trap break is easier and more convenient.
However, if you don't want to modify the program or
reassemble it, or if you realise that you need a breakpoint
after execution has already started, then an external break
is better.
</p>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-orga5259b2" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="orga5259b2"><span class="section-number-4">2.11.1.</span> Trap break</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-2-11-1">
<p>
A trap break is a trap instruction whose first operand
register contains the value 4.  The other operand registers
are ignored.  When this instruction is executed, the emulator
will stop execution, and you can resume execution later by
clicking Step or Run.
</p>

<p>
Suppose you want to check what the load instruction is doing
in this code:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-Sigma16">...
add    R1,R2,R3
load   R4,x[R1]
...
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Insert a breakpoint just <i>before</i> the instruction you want to
examine.  The breakpoint requires two instructions.  The
first instruction loads the break code into some register
(say R9 but it doesn't matter which), and the second
instruction is a trap which performs the break.  The first
operand is the register that contains the break code, and the
other two operands are ignored, so we can just use R0.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-Sigma16">...
add    R1,R2,R3
lea    R9,4       ; R9 := trap break code
trap   R9,R0,R0   ; breakpoint
load   R4,x[R1]
...
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Now you can run the program at full speed, but when it
executes the trap instruction, the emulator will stop.  Since
the trap instruction has just executed, it will be
highlighted in red, and the instruction you're interested in
&#x2013; the load &#x2013; will be highlighted in blue.  You can single
step for a while, and click Run again at any time to resume
full speed execution.
</p>

<p>
A common technique is to put a trap break at the beginning of
a loop.  By clicking Run repeatedly, you can step through the
loop iterations.
</p>

<p>
For an example of a long running program with a trap break,
see Examples / Core / Testing / Looper.

<h4 id="org7892910"><span class="section-number-4">2.11.2.</span> External break</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-2-11-2">
<p>
An external break tells the emulator to perform a breakpoint
without modifying the program.  Use these steps to set an
external break:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Find the address of the instruction to stop at: look at
the assembly listing, find the instruction, and the
listing gives its address.</li>
<li>Go to the processor page, click Boot and then click
Breakpoint.</li>
<li>A small window will appear; type in the breakpoint
address.  It must be a hexadecimal address in assembly
language format: it must begin with a $ and then contain
four hex digits.  No other characters may be present, not
even white space.</li>
<li>Click Refresh.  This parses the address you entered and
remembers it.  (If you change the address in the window,
click Refresh again.)</li>
<li>Click Enable.  This turns on the breakpoint.</li>
<li>Click CLose.  The breakpoint popup window will disappear
so you can see the Processor again.</li>
</ol>

<p>
Now click Run and the program will execute at full speed.
When the pc register is equal to the breakpoint address, the
emulator will stop.  Then you can Step or Run to continue
execution.
</p>

<p>
As long as the breakpoint is enabled, execution will stop
every time that location is encountered.  To prevent this,
open the breakpoint popup again and click Disable.

<h3 id="orge67bd9e"><span class="section-number-3">3.1.</span> Defining symbols with equ</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3-1">
<p>
Sometimes a program needs to use a constant.  For example,
you may need to use an unusual logic function that doesn't
have a built-in pseudoinstruction.  There are
pseudoinstructions for the most common logic operations:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-Sigma16">andb   R2,R7,9,13      ; R2.9 := R2.9 and R7.13
</pre>
</div>

<p>
But suppose you want to use a less common logic function (for
example, nand) that doesn't have a pseudoinstruction.  You
can use the general logic instruction and specify the
encoding of the logic function you need.  The encoding for
the nand function is 14, so you need this instruction:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-Sigma16">logicb R2,R7,9,13,14   ; R2.9 := R2.9 nand R7.13
</pre>
</div>

<p>
However, it's poor programming style to use magic constants
like 14 in your program.  It's easy to get them wrong, it
makes the code harder to understand, someone else reading the
program will wonder what the 14 means, and you might even
forget it yourself.
</p>

<p>
The assembler provides the <b>equ</b> statement for defining
symbols.  The symbol you're defining goes in the label field.
The operation is equ, and the operand is the value of the
symbol.  Thus you can write "nand equ 14" to define the
symbol:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-Sigma16">nand equ     14             ; logic code for nand
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Now you can write nand instead of 14:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-Sigma16">logicb R2,R7,9,13,nand  ; R2.9 := R2.9 nand R7.13
</pre>
</div>

<p>
An equ statement must appear before any use of the symbol
that it defines.
</p>

<p>
This kind of statement, which doesn't generate an instruction
but merely gives the assembler some additional information,
is called a directive.  It is not a machine instruction.
</p>

<p>
In a program that does lots of logic, you could define the
logic functions near the beginning of the program:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-Sigma16">; Symbolic names for common logic function codes
invx equ     12
and  equ     1
or   equ     7
xor  equ     6
nand equ     14
nor  equ     8
xnor equ     9
</pre>
</div>

<p>
There are many applications for the equ statement, besides
defining logic function constants.  You can give a symbolic
name to condition code flags you need, and for flags in
system control registers, and for the indices of fields in
your application program.  If you have size constants, such
as the number of elements in an array or the size of a stack
or heap, you can define them with equ.
</p>

<p>
If you want to load the value of an equ symbol into a
register, use lea:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-Sigma16">lea    R3,nand[R0]  ; R3 := code for nand logic function

<p>
It isn't required to have a semicolon ; before every comment.
If an assembly language statement has an operation field and
an operand field, then everything after the operand field is
taken to be a comment, so the semicolon is not required.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-Sigma16">     lea   R3,42[R0]    ; This is a comment
     load  R5,xyz[R0]   and this is also a comment
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Although most assembly language statements have an operand
field, some do not.  In these cases, the semicolon is
required to indicate a comment.
</p>

<p>
It's good style to use a semicolon consistently to indicate a
comment, even where it wouldn't be required.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-3-2-2">
<p>
In an RX instruction, if you omit the [Reg] after the
displacement, the assembler will automatically use [R0].
Thus lea R3,42 is an abbreviation for the complete form, lea
R3,42[R0].  The following two assembly language statements
describe the same instruction (their machine language code is
identical):
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

You can write the instruction either way; both are translated
to exactly the same machine language, and they execute
exactly the same way.  These are also equivalent:

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3-3">
<p>
The Sigma16 architecture provides two general logic
instructions: logicf operates on fields within a word, and
logicb operates on individual bits.  Those two general
instructions implement all possible logic functions on two
operands, not just inv, and, or, xor.  See the Architecture
section below for an explanation of logicf and logicb.
</p>

<p>
To simplify programming, Sigma16 also provides
pseudoinstructions for commonly used logic operations on
words and bits.  These are described below, and they are
sufficient for many applications.  For each
pseudoinstruction, the assembler generates an equivalent
logicf or logicb instruction.
</p>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-org0fcfbc5" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org0fcfbc5"><span class="section-number-4">3.3.1.</span> Word logic</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-3-3-1">
<p>
Word logic operations are "bitwise": bit \(i\) of the result
depends on bit \(i\) of each operand, and does not depend on
bits at any other index.  There are pseudoinstructions for
the most common word logic operations: invw, andw, orw, xorw.
</p>

<p>
The invw pseudoinstruction inverts all the bits in a
register:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-Sigma16">lea   R3,$f0f0[R0]   ; R3 := f0f0
invw  R3             ; R3 := 0f0f
</pre>
</div>

<p>
The other word logic pseudoinstructions take two register
operands.  They calculate the result and place the result in
the first operand register, overwriting its previous value.
There is not a separate destination register, as in the add
instruction.
</p>

<p>
For example, andw R1,R2 calculates the logical <i>and</i> of R1
and R2, and places the result in the destination register R1.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-Sigma16">lea   R1,$f0f0[R0]   ; R1 := f0f0
lea   R2,$00ff[R0]   ; R2 := 00ff
andw  R1,R2          ; R1 := 00f0
</pre>
</div>

<p>
The orw (logical inclusive or) and xorw (logical exclusive
or) instructions are similar.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

There are also pseudoinstructions that perform logic on two

You can set an individual bit in a register at a specified
index to 0 using clearb.  The first operand is a register,
and the second operand is the index of the bit.  All other
bits in the register remain unchanged.  So clearb R3,2 makes
R3.2 zero (that is, the bit at index 2 in R3).  All the other
bits in R3 remain unchanged.

<h4 id="org905f2f0"><span class="section-number-4">3.4.3.</span> Extracting fields</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-3-4-3">
<p>
A common situation, especially in systems programming, is
that you have a word that contains several fields.  A machine
language instruction is like that; also a network packet
contains a number of fields.  The sizes of the fields, and
their positions within a word, can be anything.  Software,
especially systems programming, often needs to be able to
extract a field from a word and put it somwhere else so it
can be used.
</p>

<p>
It's possible to obtain any field from a register, and put it
somewhere in another register, using a sequence of shift and
logic instructions (particularly shiftl, shiftr, andw, orw).
However, these sequences of instructions are error prone,
hard to read, and they execute frequently in the inner loop
of many systems programs.
</p>

<p>
Sigma16 provides an instruction <i>extract</i> which solves this
problem with just one instruction.  It allows you to extract
an arbitrary field from a register and put it into an
arbitrary location in another register.
</p>

<p>
The extract instruction takes operands that specify the
source register (which contains the field you're interested
in), the destination register (where it will put the field),
the location of the field in the source register (specifed as
the index of the rightmost and leftmost bits in the field),
and the location where you want to put the field in the
destination register.
</p>

<p>
This instruction copies 4 bits from R1.4:7 to R2:8:11:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-Sigma16">extract  R2,R1,8,4,7   ; R2.8:11 := R1.4:7
</pre>
</div>

<p>
In this example, the operands are:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>R2 is the destination register</li>
<li>R1 is the source register</li>
<li>8 is the index of the rightmost bit in the destination
where the field will be placed at ascending bit indices</li>
<li>4 is the index of the rightmost bit of the field in the
source register</li>
<li>7 is the index of the leftmost bit of the field in the
source register</li>
</ul>

<p>
This instruction is equivalent to the following (although it
is just one instruction, not four instructions):
</p>

<pre class="example" id="orge51f750">
R2.8  :=  R1.4
R2.9  :=  R1.5
R2.10 :=  R1.6
R2.11 :=  R1.7 
</pre>

<p>
The extract instruction modifies only the specified bits in
the destination register; the other bits remain unchanged.
Here is an example:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-Sigma16">lea      R1,$00f0[R0]  ; R1 = 00f0
add      R2,R0,R0      ; R2 = 0000   
extract  R2,R1,8,4,7   ; R2 = 0f00  R2.8:11 := R1.4:7

<h3 id="orgfaa792e"><span class="section-number-3">3.5.</span> Saving and restoring contiguous registers</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3-5">
<p>
There are several situations where a program needs to store a
sequence of registers into consecutive memory
locations. Later the registers must be reloaded from the
block of memory.  One example is a procedure call; another
example is gaining access to all the fields of a record.
These operations are supported by the save and restore
instructions.
</p>

<p>
The following save instruction stores R3, R4, &#x2026;, R9 into
consecutive memory locations, starting at 5[R14]:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-Sigma16">    save    R3,R9,5[R14]   ; save R3 to R9
</pre>
</div>

<p>
The save is equivalent to a sequence of individual store
instructions:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-Sigma16">    store   R3,5[R14]
    store   R4,6[R14]
    store   R5,7[R14]
    store   R6,8[R14]
    store   R7,9[R14]
    store   R8,10[R14]
    store   R9,11[R14]
</pre>
</div>

<p>
To get the values from memory back into the registers, use
this restore instruction:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-Sigma16">     restore R3,R9,5[R14]  ; restore R3 to R9
</pre>
</div>

<p>
The restore is equivalent to a sequence of individual load
instructions:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-Sigma16">    load    R3,5[R14]
    load    R4,6[R14]
    load    R5,7[R14]
    load    R6,8[R14]
    load    R7,9[R14]
    load    R8,10[R14]
    load    R9,11[R14]
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Using save and restore makes the code shorter and more
readable, and it's easier to check that the save an restore
match each other.

<div id="outline-container-sec-modules" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-modules"><span class="section-number-3">3.6.</span> Modules and linking</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-sec-modules">
<p>
A <b>module</b> is a section of a program; it may be the complete
program or just a part of it.  A module may be saved in a
file or it may simply be text in the editor buffer.  A
program may consist of just one module, or it can be split
between several files.
</p>

<p>
The Editor page contains a text area called the <b>editor
buffer</b>.  When you launch Sigma16, there is one module whose
text is empty and displayed in the editor buffer.  You can
type a program (to be precise, a module) into the editor
buffer.  When you switch to the Assembler page, the Assemble
button will translate the text in the editor buffer to
machine language, which you can execute on the Processor
page.
</p>

<p>
After entering a program in the editor buffer, you should
save it to a file.  Click Save and the text in the editor
buffer will be written to a file on your computer.  Depending
on how the system is configured, there may be a dialogue box
asking you for a file name, or a generic default file name
may be used (for example, "S16DownloadFile (2).txt" or
something similar).
</p>

<p>
Another approach is to use a separate text editor, and to
copy/paste text between the external editor and the Editor
page on Sigma16.
</p>

<p>
To create a new module without destroying the existing one,
click <b>New</b> in the editor page.  This will make a new module
with empty text and display that in the editor buffer, so any
text you had there will disappear.  However, that text isn't
lost, it's just hidden, and to get it back you just need to
select the previous module.
</p>

<p>
The <b>Modules</b> page shows a list of all the modules and allows
you to select one to work on.  The modules are shown in small
sections separated by horizontal lines.  The modules are
numbered starting from 0, so if there are n modules their
numbers go from 0 to n-1.  For each module, the module number
is shown, followed by some buttons to operate on that module,
and some information about it.  The first few lines of the
module are shown.  If you follow good programming style,
where the first rew lines of each module identify the
program, you'll be able to see at a glance what each module
is without visiting it in the editor.
</p>

<p>
Several buttons appear for each module in the list.  At any
time, one of the modules is <b>selected</b>. Click the Select
button for any module to select that one.  The selected
module number is highlighted in red, and when you go to the
Editor page the text of the selected module appears in the
editor buffer.  This means you can have several programs open
at the same time, and just switch from one to the other using
the Select buttons in the Modules page.
</p>

<p>
You can also get rid of a module by clicking its Close
button.  This will delete its text, so it may be a good idea
to select it and download it in the Editor before closing it.
</p>

<p>
So far we have just created new modules by clicking <b>New</b> (in
either the Editor page or the Modules page).  You can also
read files on your computer into Sigma16.  Click <b>Choose
files</b> and a dialogue box will pop up.  You can select one or
more files, and these will now appear in the list of modules.
</p>

<p>
If a module was created by reading it from a file, its entry
in the list contains an extra <b>Refresh</b> button.  Clicking
this will reread the file and you won't need to use the file
chooser dialogue box again.

A <b>register</b> is a digital circuit that can retain one word of
data.  A new value can be loaded into a register, and the
current contents may be read out.  Registers are fast, and
most computation is performed using the registers.  Sigma16
contains several groups of registers; each group is displayed
in a box on the Processor tab.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The <b>Register File</b> is an array of 16 registers named R0,

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-4-3">
<p>
In Sigma16, a <b>word</b> is a sequence of 16 bits.  Occasionally
we will also refer to a <b>double word</b> (a sequence of 32
bits).  A a <b>generic word</b> is a sequence of bits of arbitrary
length.  The system does not use bytes (a byte is 8 bits) or
extended words (64 bits).
</p>

<p>
The hardware components in Sigma16 are mostly 16 bits wide.
Each addressable memory location is a word, and a memory
address is a word.  Each register is a word.
</p>

<p>
By itself, a word has no inherent meaning: it is just a
sequence of bits.  Some instructions operate on a word
without regard to what it means: for example, several
instructions copy a word from one place to another and it
doesn't matter what the word means.  Other instructions act
on a word assuming that it represents some particular
primitive data type.  For example, integer arithmetic assumes
that the word represents an integer, while address arithmetic
assumes that the word represents a natural number.
</p>

<p>
Sigma16 supports natural numbers, and integers, which are
represented as words.  It also supports Booleans, which are
represented as a bit within a word.  Addresses and characters
are represented as natural numbers.

The bits of a word are indexed from right to left, starting
with index 0.  The least significant (rightmost) bit has
index 0, and the most significant bit (leftmost) has
index 15.
</p>

<p>
The notations \(x_i\) and <code>x.i</code> both mean the bit with index
\(i\) in the word \(x\), for \(0 \leq i \leq 15\).  For example,
\(x_0\) is the rightmost bit and \(x_{15}\) is the leftmost bit.
When used in an instruction, a bit index is specified as a
4-bit binary number \(i\) such that \(0 \leq i \leq 15\).
</p>

<p>
The following table shows the indices of all the bits in a

<p>
The natural numbers are \(0, 1, 2, \ldots\), so all natural
numbers are nonnegative.  Sigma16 represents natural numbers
as binary, and uses them to represent memory addresses.  The
binary value of an \(n\) bit generic word \(x\) is
</p>

<p>
\[binval (x) = \sum_{0 \leq i < n} x_i * 2^i\]
</p>

<p>
For a word of 16 bits, natural numbers are restricted to the
range from 0 through \(2^{16}-1\); that is, from 0 through
65,535.  For a double word (32 bits), natural numbers are
restricted to the range from 0 through \(2^{32}-1\); that is,
from 0 through 4,294,967,295.
</p>

<p>
A natural number (and hence a binary number) cannot be
negative.  If you need numbers that can be negative or
positive, you must use an integer.  The arithmetic
instructions in Sigma16 operate on integers, but address
arithmetic is performed in binary.

<h4 id="orge4ebec0"><span class="section-number-4">4.3.4.</span> Integers</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-4-3-4">
<p>
Integers are represented using two's complement notation.  If
the leftmost (most significant) bit of a word is 0, its two's
complement value is the same as its binary value.  If the
leftmost bit is 1, the two's complement value is negative.
</p>

<p>
Any two's complement number (with one exception) can be
negated by inverting all the bits (replace 0 by 1 and vice
versa) and then adding 1, discarding any overflow.  The sole
exception is that if the smallest negative number (\(-2^{15}\))
is negated, the result is overflow because the largest
positive integer representable in 16 bit two's complement is
\(2^{15}-1\).
</p>

<p>
For example, consider \(x\) = 1111 1010.  Since the leftmost
bit is 1, we know that \(x < 0\).  We can negate \(x\) by
inverting the bits, obtaining 0000 0101.  Adding 1 gives 0000
0110 which is 6.  Since \(-x = 6\), we conclude that \(x = -6\).

Assembly language provides several notations for expressing
the value of a word.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>A natural number between 0 and 65,535 (2<sup>16</sup> - 1)</li>
<li>An integer between -32,768 and 32,767 (-2<sup>15</sup> and 2<sup>15</sup> - 1)</li>
<li>A 4-digit hexadecimal constant, where the digits are 0-9
a-f.  The constant is preceded by $, for example $3e8c.</li>
</ul>

<p>
In assembly language programs, hexadecimal constants are
written with a preceding $ sign (e.g. $3b2f).  This is
necessary to avoid ambiguity: 1234 is a decimal number and
$1234 is a hexadecimal number, and they denote different
words.
</p>

<p>
Assembly language always requires a $ before a hexadecimal
constant.  For displays of the machine state, in contexts
where there is no ambiguity, the $ may be omitted.  For
example, the user interface displays register and memory
contents as hexadecimal without the leading $.  However, the
$ is always required for hex constants in assembly language

<p>
The memory is a hardware array of words that are accessed by
address.  A memory address is 16 bits wide, and there is one
memory location corresponding to each address, so there are
2<sup>16</sup> = 64k memory locations (1k = 1,024).  Each memory
location is a 16-bit word.
</p>

<p>
Instructions specify memory addresses in two parts: the
<b>displacement</b>, which is a word representing a binary number,
and the <b>index</b>, which is one of the registers in the
register file.  For example, a memory address could be
specified as $003c[R5]; the displacement is 003c and the
index is R5.
</p>

<p>
When the instruction is executed, the computer calculates the
<b>effective address</b> by adding the value of the displacement
and the value in the index register.  If R5 contains 2, then
the effective address of $003c[R5] is 003e.
</p>

<p>
This scheme may seem more complicated than simply specifying
the address directly, but it is flexible.  If the machine
language just gave the address as a single binary number, it
would be limited to accessing simple static variables.  The
effective address mechanism is simple to implement in
hardware, as you can see in the digital circuit processor,
yet it allows the implementation of static variables, local
variables, records, arrays, pointers and linked data
structures, jump tables, and more.  These techniques are
described later.

The <b>register file</b> is a set of 16 general registers, each of
which holds a 16 bit word.  A register is referenced by a
4-bit binary number.  In assembly language, we use the
notations R0, R1, R2, &#x2026;, R9, R10, R11, R12, R13, R14, R15
to refer to the registers.  The state of the register file
can be written as a table showing the value of each register:

Sigma16 is a load/store style architecture.  All calculations
are carried out in the register file, and explicit load and
store instructions must be used to copy data between the
memory and the register file.
</p>

<p>
R0 and R15 are special.  The other registers, R1 through R14,
may be used for any purpose.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>R0 always contains the constant 0.</li>
</ul>

<p>
It is legal to perform an instruction that attempts to load
some other value into R0, but the register will still contain
0 after executing such an instruction.  Such an instruction
will simply have no lasting effect.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>R15 is the condition code register.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-org8a537a4" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org8a537a4"><span class="section-number-4">4.5.2.</span> Condition code</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-4-5-2">
<p>
Several instructions produce status information: the result
of a comparison, whether there was an overflow, etc.  This
information is automatically loaded into R15, which is also
called the <i>condition code</i>.  The description of each
instruction states whether R15 is modified, and what goes
into it.
</p>

<p>
Each bit in the condition code (R15) is a Boolean that
specifies whether a specific condition is false (0) or true
(1).  The bits are indexed from bit 0 (rightmost, or least
significant) to bit 15 (the leftmost, or most significant).
Condition code bits are sometimes called <i>flags</i>.  Each flag
gives the status of a relation or event.  If the flag is True
(1) the relation holds or the event has occurred.  If the
flag is False (0) the relation does not hold, or the event
has not occurred.
</p>

<p>
One way to use flags in the condition code is to control
conditional jumps.  The jumpc0 and jumpc1 instructions are
conditional jumps that use a flag in R15 to decide whether to
jump:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Use jumpc0 to jump if the Boolean is False</li>
<li>Use jumpc1 to jump if the Boolean is True</li>
</ul>

<p>
Both jumpc0 and jumpc1 take two operands.  The first is a
natural number from 0 to 15, which gives the index of a flag
in the condition code.  The second is an address to jump to,
specified as displacement[index].  The indices of the flags
are given below.
</p>

<p>
The two conditional jumps (jumpc0 and jumpc1) let you jump
depending on either the truth or falsity of a condition.  For
example, the flag at index 4 denotes integer less than.  The
fist pair of instructions below jumps if the less than
condition holds, and the second pair jumps if the less than
condition is false.  This is equivalent to jumping if the
"greater than or equal" condition holds.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-Sigma16">cmp     R8,R9
jumpc1  4,xyz[R0] ; if R8 &lt; R9 then goto xyz
...
cmp     R8,R9
jumpc0  4,xyz[R0] ; if R8 &gt;= R9 then goto xyz
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Programs usually use pseudoinstructions rather than the
actual machine instructions jumpc0 and jumpc1.  For example,
the following two instructions are equivalent: the assembler
generates exactly the same machine language code for them.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-Sigma16">jumpc1  4,xyz[R0] ; if R8 &lt; R9 then goto xyz
jumplt  xyz[R0]   ; if R8 &lt; R9 then goto xyz
</pre>
</div>

<p>
In effect, the pseudoinstruction lets you omit the flag index
and instead to indicate the condition you want in the
mnemonic.  It's easier to remember that less than is
indicated by lt than by 4.
</p>

<p>
Another way to use condition code flags is to save them as
Boolean variables and perform logic operations on them.  In
this case it's best to copy a flag to another register, using
copyb.  From there you can evaluate logic expressions using
andb, orb, xorb, and logicb.  It isn't a good idea to keep
Boolean variables in R15 for a long time, because many
instructions will modify it.
</p>

<p>
Before doing logic operations on condition code bits,
consider whether "short circuit" evaluation, with a separate
comparison followed by conditional jump for each relation, is
more appropriate.
</p>

<p>
There is not just one flag for "less than" and another for
"greater than".  There are separate flags for integers
(represented as two's complement) and natural numbers
(represented as binary).  This is necessary because the
relation between two words sometimes depends on the type of
the data.  For example, consider the word ffff (all 1 bits).
On its own, ffff is just a word of bits and has no inherent
meaning.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>If ffff is interpreted as a natural number (i.e. binary),
it is positive and has the value 65,535, and ffff &gt; 0000.</li>
<li>If ffff is interpreted as an integer (i.e. two's
complement), then it is negative and has the value -1, and
ffff &lt; 0000.</li>
</ul>

<p>
The cmp instruction compares two words, and evaluates five
relations between the words: equality, less than for both
natural and integer, and greater than for both natural and
integer.  These evaluations are performed simultaneously,
using parallelism in the ALU circuit, and the result of each
is recorded in the corresponding flag in the condition code.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-Sigma16">    cmp    R5,R6
    jumpc1 3,lessNat[R0]  ; if R5 &lt;Nat R6 then goto lessNat
    ...
    cmp    R7,R8
    jumpc1 4,LessInt[R0]  ; if R7 &lt;Int R8 then goto lessInt
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Thus you don't specify the types of the operands in the cmp
instruction.  Instead, you select the condition code flag
that corresponds to the types.
</p>

<p>
Each flag has a short 1-character name to enable it to be
displayed compactly in the user interface.  A naming
convention is that flags for integers (two's complement) have
lower case letters, while flags for natural numbers (binary)
have upper case letters.  For example:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>l means &lt; for integers</li>
<li>L means &lt; for natural numbers</li>
<li>g means &gt; for integers</li>
<li>G means &gt; for natural numbers</li>
</ul>

<p>
Equality is the same regardless of type.  If two words
consist of exactly the same bits, then they have the same
value as integers, natural numbers, characters, addresses,
and for any other possible type as well.  Therefore there is
only one flag for equality, and its symbol is =.
</p>

<p>
Register R15 is also called the <i>condition code</i>.  Some
instructions modify a bit in the condition code to indicate
the results of comparisons, overflow, carry, other special
data, and various errors.  Instructions that operate on
registers can access R15 as usual. There are also some
instructions that implicitly access R15 without specifying it
(for example, jumpc0 and jumpc1).  Since many instructions
modify the condition code as a side effect, programs should
not use R15 to hold variables.
</p>

<p>
The following table lists all the condition code flags.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Index is the bit position of the flag in the condition
code.  Bits are numbered from right to left, starting
with 0.</li>
<li>Symbol: the graphical user interface shows the symbol for
each bit that is 1.  For example, if G is displayed after a
comparison of two words, this means that &gt; holds if the
words are interpreted as natural numbers but not if they
are interpreted as integers.  However, if G&gt; is displayed,
the comparison result is greater than for both integer and
two's complement representation.</li>
<li>Meaning: Description using English or mathematical notation</li>
<li>Hex: The value of the condition code word assuming the
given flag is true and all others are false.  If several
flags are true, the condition code register will be the
logic or of the hex values of the true flags.  For example,
suppose the words 00a3 is compared with 00c5.  The
comparison result is L (less than for naturals) and also l
(less than for integers).  So the condition code will
contain 0008 + 0010 = 0018.</li>

There is an exception for division by zero, but no
corresponding flag in the condition code.  The reason is that
the div instruction places the remainder in R15, so the
condition code isn't available to represent division by 0.
You can use an interrupt to detect division by 0, and you can
test explicity for division by 0 by using jumpz specifying
the register containing the divisor before executing the div
instruction.

If the processor is in system state, any instruction can be

When the system is started by booting a program, the status
is set to system state.  If the program is just a standalone
program (such as the simple examples), you can ignore the

should put the processor into user state when it gives a time

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-4-6">
<p>
An interrupt is a jump performed automatically by the machine
in response to an event, not by executing a jump instruction.
Interrupts are used for error detection and recovery,
input/output, concurrency, memory protection, and virtual
memory.  Most of these features are implemented by an
operating system kernel.
</p>

<p>
There are two kinds of event that can trigger an interrupt:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>An error that occurs while executing an instruction.  For
example, an arithmetic instruction could produce a result
that is too large to represent in a word (this is called
overflow).  Sometimes this is called an <i>exception</i>, and
sometimes it is called an interrupt.</li>
<li>An external event that has nothing to do with the running
program, but which needs to be handled.  For example, an
I/O device may request an interrupt when it has completed
an I/O operation.  This is always called an interrupt.</li>
</ul>

<p>
There are several types of interrupt.  Each type has a unique
index.  The interrupt indices serve two purposes: they
determine the interrupt priority, and they give the bit index
for the interrupt type in the mask and request registers.
The following table shows each type of interrupt and the bit
index of its flag.

<p>
Each type of interrupt has a priority which is determined by
its index: a lower index indicates higher priority.  Thus the
timer interrupt has the highest priority, and a stack
overflow has higher priority than integer overflow.
</p>

<p>
Interrupts take place only between execution of instructions.
When one instruction has finished, the processor checks for
interrupts before going on to the next instruction.  This
consists of the following steps:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>If interrupts are not enabled, the check terminates and
the next instruction is executed normally.</li>
<li>If interrupts are enabled, and there is an interrupt
request, and the corresponding mask bit is enabled, an
interrupt will take place.  If several types of interrupt
meet these conditions, the one with highest priority
(lowest index) is selected.  Let i be the index of the
type of interrupt that was selected.</li>
<li>The processor clears the request bit for the interrupt in
the request register, it copies the status register into
rstat, and it copies the pc register into the rpc
register.  Also, it loads mem[vect+2*i] into the pc
register, and it and sets flags in the status register to
indicate system state and interrupts disabled.</li>
<li>If the timer is running, it is stopped.</li>
<li>Now the interrupt has completed, and the next instruction
is executed normally.  Since the pc has been modified, the
machine has jumped to a different location.</li>
</ol>

<p>
This algorithm is performed entirely by the processor; none
of it involves software.  Although it is described as a
sequence of steps, many of these steps can be performed in
parallel, because digital circuits are inherently parallel.
If an interrupt does not take place, the time required for
the check is minimal (less than one clock cycle), so checking
for interrupts does not signicantly slow down the processor
speed.

<p>
Instructions are represented in the memory of the computer
using words, just like all other kinds of data.  From the
programmer's perspective, an instruction is like a simple
statement in a programming language.  From the circuit
designer's perspective, instructions must be executed using
logic gates, and the specific way it is represented as a word
of bits is important.
</p>

<p>
An instruction specifies several pieces of information.  For
example, the instruction <code>add R1,R2,R3</code> says four things:
it's an addition, the operands come from R2 and R3, and the
result goes into R1.  Therefore to represent an instruction
we need to organize a word as a collection of several
<b>fields</b>.  A field is a portion of a word that contains a
small number (for example, a register number). Each field
gives one specific piece of information about the
instruction.
</p>

<p>
The particular scheme for describing an instruction as a
collection of fields is called an <b>instruction format</b>.  Like
most computers, Sigma16 has a small number of instruction
formats and a larger number of instructions.  Instruction
representation is key to both system software (compilers
generate instructions) and computer hardware (a processor is
a digital circuit that decodes and executes instructions).
</p>

<p>
The core architecture (the simplest part of the system) uses
two instruction formats: the <b>RRR format</b> for instructions
that perform calculations in the registers, and the <b>RX
format</b> for instructions that refer to a memory location.
</p>

<p>
The advanced parts of the architecture provide additional
instructions, most of which are represented with the <b>EXP
format</b>. The name EXP stands simultaneously for <b>expansion</b>
(because it provides for many additional instructions) and
<b>experimental</b> (because it allows for experimentation with
the design and implementation of new instructions).
</p>

<p>
Each instruction format has a fixed size, which is the number
of words used to represent any instruction of that format:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>RRR instructions are one word</li>
<li>RX instructions are two words</li>
<li>EXP instructions are two words</li>
</ul>

<p>
The first word of every instruction (for all instruction
formats) contains the following fields:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>op (bits 15-12) 4-bit opcode, determines instruction format</li>
<li>d  (bits 11-8)  4-bit destination</li>
<li>a  (bits 7-4)   4-bit operand a</li>
<li>b  (bits 3-0)   4-bit operand b, or expanded opcode for RX</li>
</ul>

<p>
The format of every instruction is determined by the op
field.  Since this field contains 4 bits, it can specify 16
values:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>$RRR.$ If the op field is between 0 and 12 (hex 0 to hex
c), the instruction is RRR format, and there are 13 RRR
instructions.</li>

<li><b>Reserved.</b> An op field value of 13 is reserved for future
expansion of the architecture.</li>

<li><b>EXP.</b> If the op field is 14 (hex e) the instruction is EXP
format and has a secondary opcode in the a and b fields.</li>

<li><b>RX.</b> If the op field contains 15 (hex f) the instruction
is RX format with a secondary opcode in the b field.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Since an RRR instruction is one word, it contains just the
op, d, a, b fields.  If an instruction is RX or EXP format,
it has a second word whose format is described below in the
sections on RX and EXP.

<p>
The RRR format is used for instructions that perform
calculations in the registers, without using memory.
</p>

<p>
An instruction in RRR format is one word containing four
4-bit fields called op, d, a, b.  Each field contains 4 bits
representing a binary number between 0 and 15.

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>op (bits with index 15 to 12) is the operation code,
usually called <i>opcode</i>.  This determines the operation to
be performed.  If the opcode is between 0 and 12 it
specifies an RRR instruction.  An opcode greater than 12
indicates an <i>expanding opcode</i>: the instruction is not RRR
but one of the other formats, and it has a secondary opcode
that specifies precisely which instruction it is.  This is
explained in the sections on RX and EXP formats.</li>

<li>d (bits 11 to 8) is the <i>destination register</i>; the
register where (in most cases) the result will be loaded.</li>

<li>a (bits 7 to 4) is the register containing the first
operand.</li>

<li>b (bits 3 to 0) is the register containing the second
operand.</li>
</ul>

<p>
In most cases, an RRR instruction takes two operands in
registers specified by the a and b fields and produces a
result which is loaded into the register specified by the d
field.
</p>

<p>
A typical example of an RRR instruction is add R4,R13,R2,
which adds the contents of registers R13 and R2, and loads
the result into R4.  It's equivalent to R4 := R13 + R2.  The
opcode for add is 0, so the machine language code for this
instruction is 04d2.

<div id="outline-container-org6c8e84f" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org6c8e84f"><span class="section-number-4">5.1.2.</span> RX format</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-5-1-2">
<p>
The RX format is used for instructions that use a memory
location.  There are two operands: one is a register and the
other is the address of a word in memory.  Typical RX
instructions are loads, stores, and jumps.  For example, a
load has an address operand and a destination register
operand; it loads the word in memory at the specified address
into the destination register.
</p>

<p>
A memory address is just a natural number.  However, the
second operand of an RX instruction, a memory address, is
specified by two pieces: an index register and a
natural number called the displacement.
</p>

<p>
The name of the format describes briefly these
two pieces: a register (R) and an indexed memory address
(X).
</p>

<p>
The instruction consists of two consecutive words.  The first
has the same format as an RRR instruction, with four fields:
op, d, sa, sb.  The second word is a single 16-bit binary
number, and is called the displacement.
</p>

<p>
An RX instruction is represented by two words.
The first word has the same fields as an RRR instruction:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The op field (bits 15-12) is 15 (hex f).  This indicates
that the instruction has format</li>
<li>The d field (bits 11-8) is the first operand, the
destination register.</li>
<li>The a field (bits 7-4) is called the index register, and is
part of the specification of the effective address.</li>
<li>The b field (bits 3-0) is the secondary opcode.</li>
</ul>

<p>
The second word contains one field, the 16 bit displacement.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>disp (displacement) is the second word of the instruction</li>
</ul>

  </tr>

<p>
ea (effective address) = displacement + r[a]
</p>

<p>
The memory address is specified in two parts: an index
register and the displacement.  The index register is
specified in the sa field.  In assembly language, the
notation used is number[reg], where the number is the value
of the displacement, and the reg is the index register.  Thus
$20b3[R2] means the address has displacement $20b3 and the
index register is R2.
</p>

<p>
When the machine executes an RX instruction, it begins by
calculating the effective address.  This is abbreviated "ea",
and its value is the sum of the displacement and the contents
of the index register.
</p>

<p>
RX instructions are represented in two words, and they use an
"expanding opcode".  That is, the op field of the first word
of the instruction contains the constant f (the bits 1111)
for every RX instruction, and the sb field is used to hold a
secondary opcode indicating which RX instruction it is.
</p>

<p>
The register operand is specified in the d field.  For
several RX instructions, this is indeed the destination of
the instruction: for example, load places data into Rd.
However, a few RX instructions use the d field differently
(see, for example, the conditional jump instructions).
</p>

<p>
The memory address is specified using the sa field and the
displacement, which is the entire second word of the
instruction.
</p>

<p>
The RX format is used for instructions that access the
memory.  There are two operands: a memory address and a
register.  The memory address is specified using two fields:
a constant (called the displacement) and a register (called
the index register).
</p>

<p>
An RX instruction consists of two words.  The first has the
same format as RRR.  The op field is 15, which means "this
instruction has RX format".  A secondary operation code is
needed to specify which RX instruction this is, this is given
in the b field.  The d field is the destination register, and
the a field is the index register.  There is only one operand
register for RX instructions, since the b field is needed for
the secondary operation code.

<p>
The index register Rb and the displacement together specify
the <i>effective address</i>.  The assembly language syntax for
the effective address is <code>disp[Rb]</code>, and its value is
\(\mathrm{disp} + \mathrm{Rb}\).  For example, suppose R4
contains 7 when the following instruction is executed:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-Sigma16">load  R2,5[R4]
</pre>
</div>

<p>
The address operand is <code>5[R4]</code>, where the displacement is 5
and the index is R4.  When the instruction executes, the
effective address is \(5 + \mathrm{R4} = 5 + 7 = 12\), or
<code>$000c</code>.
</p>

<p>
The displacement is a constant given in the instruction, but
the index register is variable.  Since R0 always contains 0,
the effective address for <code>disp[R0]</code> is the value of <code>disp</code>.
</p>

<p>
The displacement is represented in binary, and the effective
address is calculated in binary, not in two's complement.
Thus the effective address of <code>ffff[R0]</code> is the (positive)
address of the last word in memory &#x2013; it isn't a negative
number.

The EXP instructions provide more complex operations, and
they belong to the Standard architecture.  (The Core
architecture uses only RRR and RX).  An EXP instruction
consists of two words.
</p>

<p>
The first word has the same op and d fields as RRR and RX.
The op field contains 14 (hex e), which indicates that the
instruction is EXP format.  The a and b fields are treated as
one 8-bit natural number, which is the secondary operation
code.  This provides for the possibility of up to 256 EXP
format instructions, which enables new experimental
instructions to be defined.

<p>
Although there are three machine language instruction formats
(RRR, RX, EXP), there is a larger set of assembly language
statement formats, because there are special syntaxes for
some instructions, and there are assembler directives that
aren't instructions at all.  Thus there are two kinds of
format: the machine instruction formats, and the assembly
language instruction statement formats.  The assembly
language formats are described later.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-5-1-5">
<p>
We usually write instructions in assembly language (sub
R3,R12,R9) but the computer executes machine language (13c9).
There is a precise relationship between these two notations
for an instruction.  By writing assembly language, you
determine the exact value of every bit in every word of a
machine language program.  This section explains how these
two notations for an instruction are related.
</p>

<p>
When each instruction is described below, an example is given
showing a typical use of the instruction, along with the
general form of the assembly language instruction.
</p>

<p>
The general form uses the machine language field names to
show where each piece of the instruction goes in the machine
code.  The instruction format is also given, along with any
constant fields.
</p>

<p>
As an example, the logicu instruction is EXP format, so its
machine language representation consists of two words with
the following fields:

<p>
The primary opcode is e, which goes in the op field.  The
secondary opcode is 14, which goes in the ab field.  Thus
op=e, a=1, and b=4 (here, a dollar sign is used before the
hex constants to distinguish them from the field names).

and the For example, here is the general form of the logicu
instruction:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-Sigma16">logicu  Rd,e,Rf,g,h     ; Rd.e := h (Rd.e, Rf.g)

<pre class="src src-Sigma16">logicu  Rd,e,Rf,g,h     ; Rd.e := h (Rd.e, Rf.g)
EXP op=#e ab=$14
</pre>
</div>

<p>
The format is EXP, so the instruction has all the fields of
the EXP format: op, d, ab, e, f, g, h.  There are two
constant fields: the primary opcode (op) is <code>$e</code>, and the
secondary opcode (ab) is <code>$14</code>.  The values of the other
fields are given in the general form of the assembly
language.  The operands Rd and Rf refer to registers, and
those register numbers go into the d and f fields of the
instruction.  The e, g, and h fields are given as numbers in
the assembly language.  (The assembly language convention is
to give constants in decimal notation, not hexadecimal.)

The instruction <code>add Rd,Ra,Rb</code> has operands <code>Ra</code> and <code>Rb</code> and
destination <code>Rd</code>.  It fetches the operands <code>Ra</code> and <code>Rb</code>,
calculates the sum <code>Ra</code> + <code>Rb</code>, and loads the result into the
destination <code>Rd</code>.  The effect is <code>Rd := Ra + Rb</code>.  For
example, <code>add R5,R12,R2</code> performs <code>R5 := R12 + R3</code>.
</p>

<p>
As well as setting the destination register, the add
instruction sets or clears the overflow and carry bits in the
condition code (which is R15).  The other bits in R15 are not
changed.
</p>

If the destination register is R15, the sum is placed in R15,
and the overflow and carry flags are discarded.

destination Rd and operands Ra and Rb (where d, a, b are hex
digits), add Rd,Ra,Rb is reprseented by 0dab.

A field is a consecutiave sequence of bits within a word.  A
field is specified with the index of the leftmost bit in the
field, along with the size of the field.  For example, the

The instruction add Rd,Ra,Rb has operands Ra and Rb and
destination Rd.  It fetches the operands Ra and Rb,
calculates the sum Ra + Rb, and loads the result into the
destination Rd.  The effect is Rd := Ra + Rb.  For example,
add R5,R12,R2 performs R5 := R12 + R3.

The add instruction is RRR format with opcode=0.  Given
destination Rd and operands Ra and Rb (where d, a, b are hex
digits), add Rd,Ra,Rb is reprseented by 0dab.
</p>

<p>
The add instruction can be used for both binary addition (on
natural numbers) and for two's complement addition (on signed
integers).

<p>
If the destination register Rd is R15, then the quotient is
placed in R15, and the remainder is discarded.
</p>

<p>
The divide instruction doesn't set the condition code, since
R15 is used for the remainder.  Therefore there is no
condition code bit to indicate division by 0.  However, it is
easy for a program to detect a division by 0.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>(Explicit test for error) The program can compare the
divisor with 0 before or after executing the divide
instruction, and jump to an error handler if the divisor
is 0.  This is similar to testing the condition code after
an add, sub, or mul instruction, but it does require two
instructions: a compare followed by a conditional jump.
For example:</li>
</ul>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-Sigma16">div    R1,R2,R3       ; R1 := R2/R3, R15 := R2 rem R3
cmp    R3,R0       ; Did we divide by 0?
jumpeq zeroDivide[R0] ; If yes, handle error
</pre>
</div>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>(Exception) The program can detect division by 0 using an
interrupt.  To do this, enable interrupts and enable the
interrupt mask for division by 0.  See the section on
Interrupts.  This approach does not require a compare or
jump instruction for each division.</li>

The compare instruction <code>cmp Ra,Rb</code> compares the values in

<p>
The result of a cmp instruction can be used to control a
conditional jump.  The jumpc0 instruction jumps is a
specified bit of R15 is 0, and the jumpc1 instruction jumps
if a specified bit is 1.
</p>

<p>
Pseudoinstructions provide the most common cases; for example
jumple jumps if the condition code indicates that a
comparison produced either integer less-than or equal.  A
common pattern is a cmp followed by a jump pseudoinstruction,
for example:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-Sigma16">cmp     R4,R9      ; compare R4 with R9
jumpgt  abc]R0]    ; if R4 &gt; R9 then goto abc

<p>
The addc instruction performs a binary addition with carry
propagation.  It adds the two operand registers and the carry
bit in the condition code register, R15.  The sum is loaded
into the destination register Rd and the carry output is
written back into the carry bit, overwriting its previous
value.  Overflow is not possible with this instruction.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-5-3">
<p>
A memory address is a 16-bit binary number.  Instructions
don't specify addresses directly; they specify an address
with two components: a <b>displacement</b> and an <b>index</b>, written
as "displacement[index]".  The displacement is a 16 bit
constant, and in assembly language it may be given as a
decimal integer, a hexadecimal word, or a label.  The index
is a register.  For example,$0c45[R5] has a displacement of
0c45 and an index of R5.
</p>

<p>
When an instruction executes, the machine takes the
displacement and index and calculates the <b>effective
address</b>.  This is defined to be the binary sum of the
displacement and the curent value in the index register.  In
the example above, if R5 contains 3, then the effective
address of $0c45[R5] is $0c48.
</p>

<p>
If you just want to specify an address <b>a</b> in an instruction,
this can be written as "a[R0]".  Since R0 contains the
constant 0, the effective address is just <b>a</b>.

<p>
Store copies the word in the destination register into memory
at the effective address.  This instruction is unusual in
that it treats the "destination register" as the source of
data, and the actual destination which is modified is the
memory location.
</p>

<p>
Most instructions take data from the rightmost operands and
modify the leftmost destination, just like an assignment
statement (x := y+z).  However, the store instruction
operates in the opposite direction.  The reason for this has
to do with the circuit design of the processor.  Although the
"left to right" nature of the store instruction may look
inconsistent from the programmer's point of view, it actually
is more consistent from the deeper perspective of circuit
design.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-5-3-4">
<p>
Three instructions (push, pop, top) support operations on a
stack represented as an array of contiguous elements, where
the stack grows from lower to higher addresses.  These
instructions provide safe operations: they never overwrite
memory outside the stack, and they indicate stack underflow
and overflow by setting the condition code and optionaly
performing an exception.
</p>

<p>
A stack is represented by three addresses, which are provided
to the push, pop, and top instructions in registers:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The <i>stack base</i> is the address of the first word allocated
for the stack.</li>
<li>The <i>stack limit</i> is the address of the last word allocated
for the stack.</li>
<li>The <i>stack top</i> is the address of the stack element that
was pushed most recently.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Although three addresses are required to characterise the
state of a stack, each individual stack instruction (push,
pop, top) requires only two of those addresses.  These are
supplied as the Ra and Rb operands, while Rd is used to
supply or receive the data value.
</p>

<p>
The maximum number of elements the stack may contain is
<i>stack limit</i> - <i>stack base</i> + 1.  Normally, <i>stack limit</i> is
greater than <i>stack base</i>.  If they are equal, there is only
one word allocated for the stack (which is generally not
useful), and if <i>stack base</i> &gt; <i>stack limit</i> then no memory
at all is allocated and every stack operation will signal an
underflow or overflow error.
</p>

<p>
If the stack is not empty, then <i>stack top</i> is the address of
the top element in the stack.  If the stack is empty, then
<i>stack top</i> must be <i>stack base</i> - 1.
</p>

<p>
A stack can be created and initialized by allocating a region
of memory, setting <i>stack base</i> to the first word and <i>stack
limit</i> to the last word, and setting <i>stack top</i> to <i>stack
base</i> - 1.

<h4 id="org3c72d0d"><span class="section-number-4">5.3.5.</span> push</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-5-3-5">
<p>
The push instruction pushes an element onto a stack.  It is
RRR format, and its general form is:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-Sigma16">push   Rd,Ra,Rb
</pre>
</div>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Rd = <i>stack data</i>: value to be pushed, unchanged</li>
<li>Ra = <i>stack top</i>: incremented unless stack was full</li>
<li>Rb = <i>stack limit</i>: unchanged</li>
<li>R15 condition code indicates stack overflow</li>
<li>System interrupt request register indicates stack overflow</li>
</ul>

<p>
This instruction pushes the word in Rd onto a stack with
<i>stack top</i> in Rd and <i>stack limit</i> in Rb, provided that the
stack is not full.  The push stores the data word in Ra into
memory and increments <i>stack top</i> Rd.  If the stack is full,
nothing is stored into memory and a stack overflow error is
indicated in the condition code and interrupt request
registers; an interrupt will occur if interrupts are enabled
and the stack mask bit is set.  The operational semantics is:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-Sigma16">if Ra &lt; Rb
  then Ra := Ra + 1; mem[Ra] := Rd
  else R15.sovfl := 1, req.sovfl := 1
</pre>
</div>

<p>
If Rd = Rb this means the stack completely fills the region
of memory allocated for the stack, and there is no space to
store a new element.  In this case, the push instruction does
not store Ra, it doesn't modify Rd, it doesn't modify memory
outside the block, and it doesn't overwrite data in the
stack.  Instead, the instruction indicates a stack overflow
by setting the sovfl (stack overflow) bit in the condition
code (R15), and it also sets the stack fault bit in the
interrupt request register.  If interrupts are enabled and
the stack fault bit is set in the interrupt mask register,
then an interrupt will occur after the push instruction
completes.  There will be no interrupt if interrupts are
disabled, or the stack fault bit is not set in the mask
register.

<li>System interrupt request register indicates stack underflow</li>
</ul>

<p>
This instruction pops the word from a stack with <i>stack top</i>
in Ra and <i>stack base</i> in Rb, provided that the stack is not
empty.  The pop loads the top element of the stack into Rd
and decrements <i>stack top</i>.  If the stack is empty, <i>stack
top</i> is not decremented, Rd is not modified, and a stack
underflow error is indicated in the condition code and
interrupt request registers; an interrupt will occur if
interrupts are enabled and the stack mask bit is set.  The
operational semantics is:

<h4 id="orgab49277"><span class="section-number-4">5.3.8.</span> Stack frames</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-5-3-8">
<p>
When a program calls a procedure it is usually necessary to
save the state of the caller in a data structure called a
stack frame.  (This is not necessary during a "tail call".)
The stack frame is pushed onto the execution stack.  When the
procedure returns, the contents of the stack frame need to be
loaded back into the registers.  These operations can be
performed by ordinary store instructions (for procedure call)
and load instructions (for procedure return).  However, this
often requires a significant number of instructions.
</p>

<p>
The <code>save</code> and <code>restore</code> instructions transfer a block of
data between registers and memory, making it easier to use
stack frames.  These instructions are analogous to <code>store</code>
and <code>load</code>, but they store or load multiple words, not just
an individual word.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>save</b> stores a sequence of adjacent registers into a block
of contiguous memory locations.</li>
<li><b>restore</b> is the opposite: it loads the block of memory
into the registers.</li>
</ul>

<p>
For both instructions, the sequence of registers is specified
by giving the first and last register.  The starting address
of the memory block is specified by an effective address of
the form <code>offset[Reg]</code>, where Reg is any register (e.g. R4,
R13, etc) and <code>offset</code> is a number between 0 and 255.
</p>

<p>
Normally \(d \leq e\), in which case the number of registers to
be saved is \(e-d + 1\).  If \(d > e\), the instruction will do
nothing.  The base register \(R_f\) should not lie within the
group of registers to be saved or restored.
</p>

<p>
The first register to be saved is \(R_d\), and the last
register to be saved is \(R_e\).  The instruction always stores
at least one register.  If \(d = e\), for example <code>save
R5,R5,0[R14]</code> then only R5 is stored.  If \(d < e\) then the
register numbers wrap around For example,
</p>

<p>
There is an important restriction with <code>save</code> and <code>restore</code>:
the displacement is limited to a small natural number between
0 and 255.  (Recall that for load and store, the displacement
can be as large as 65,535.)  The reason for this is that the
save and restore instructions are EXP format and the offset
is represented by an 8-bit field (whereas load and store are
RX format and the displacement is a 16-bit word).
</p>

<p>
The instruction is EXP format, and the offset is limited to 8
bits, because it is specified in the <b>gh</b> field, which is the
rightmost 8 bits of the second word of the instruction.  The
secondary opcode is 9, which is in the ab field of the first
word of the instruction.

<h4 id="org220f84f"><span class="section-number-4">5.3.9.</span> save</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-5-3-9">
<p>
The save instruction performs a sequence of stores, which
copy the contents of a sequence of registers into consecutive
memory locations.  It is useful for saving registers on a
procedure call or interrupt, as well as storing a record from
registers into memory.

For example, the following instruction will save registers R3
through R9 into memory starting at address 6 + R13.  Its
machine language code is e30b 9d06.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-Sigma16">    save   R3,R9,6[R13]

<p>
This instruction is equivalent to a sequence of store
instructions:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-Sigma16">    store   R3,6[R13]
    store   R4,7[R13]

    store   R7,10[R13]
    store   R8,11[R13]
    store   R9,12[R13]
</pre>

<p>
Using <code>save</code> and <code>restore</code> can make procedure calls more
concise and readable.  Even more importantly, they are less
error prone: it's easy to make a typo in sequences of store

Suppose a stack frame was created by the <code>save</code> example

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-Sigma16">restore R3,R9,6[R13]  ; e30b 9d06. store R3-R9 starting at 6[R13]
</pre>
</div>

<p>
It is equivalent to a sequence of store instructions:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-Sigma16">load   R3,6[R13]

<p>
The <b>restore</b> instruction copies a sequence of consecutive
memory locations starting from the effecive address into a
sequence of adjacent registers.  The index register (R14 in
this example) is not changed.  Restore is equivalent to a
fixed sequence of load instructions; its purpose of restore
is to restore the state of registers from memory after a
procedure call or a context switch.

that register is 1).

<p>
Sigma16 provides two logic instructions that can evaluate
arbitrary Boolean expressions.  They implement all possible
logic functions, not just the most common ones.  You can
perform logic on individual bits, on a field within words, or
on all the bits in a word.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><code>logicf</code> performs bitwise logic on corresponding fields
within two operand registers; the result overwrites the
field in the first operand.</li>
<li><code>logicb</code> performs logic on two operand bits that may be at
arbitrary indices within arbitrary registers.  The result
overwrites the first operand bit.</li>
</ul>

<p>
The assembly language provides a group of pseudoinstructions
for the most common operations. Some of these (invw, andw,
orw, xorw) are introduced in the tutorial section on logic.
It is often more convenient and readable to use the
pseudoinstructions, rather than the general <code>logicf</code> and
<code>logicb</code>.
</p>

<p>
When translating a high level language program into assembly
language, there are two ways to implement a Boolean
expression: using logic instructions, or using a sequence of
conditional jumps ("short circuit evaluation").  It's good
practice to understand both methods and to use whichever is
more appropriate in a specific situation.  Just because an
AND or OR operator appears in a program, that doesn't
necessarily mean that a logic instruction should be used.
The logic instructions are important, and have many
applications in practical programming, but it is sometimes
better to use "short circuit evaluation" instead.
</p>

<p>
The next section explains how logic functions are
represented, and the following sections describe each logic
instruction followed by its pseudoinstructions.

The commonest Boolean operators are <code>inv</code>, <code>and2</code>, <code>or2</code>, and
<code>xor2</code>.  The <code>inv</code> function (also called invert, not, logical
negation) has one input and produces one output, as defined
by the truth table:

<p>
The <code>and2</code>, <code>or2</code>, <code>xor2</code> functions have two inputs, so their
truth tables have four lines.  There are also functions with
more inputs, such as <code>and3</code> with 3 inputs, <code>and4</code> with 4
inputs, and so on.  Sigma16 doesn't have instructions for
those, but you can replace them with multiple uses of <code>and2</code>,
<code>or2</code>, etc.

<p>
These aren't the only useful operations: there are 16 logic
functions that take two arguments.  Instead of providing
specialised instructions for a few of the logic functions,
Sigma16 provides general instructions that implement all of
them.
</p>

<p>
Every logic function with two inputs \(x\) and \(y\) can be
defined by a truth table where we list all possible values
for the inputs and give the corresponding result.  Each input
could be either 0 or 1.  Since there are 2 inputs, there are
\(2^2 = 4\) lines in the truth table.
</p>

<p>
The tables above for and2, or2, xor2 give specific values,
either 0 or 1, for each result.  For example, the result
column for the <code>and2</code> function is (reading from top to
bottom) 0001, while <code>xor2</code> is 0110.  For an arbitrary
function, we can write the result column as \(abcd\) where each
variable is either 0 or 1.

If \((a,b,c,d) = (0,0,0,1)\) this is the truth table for
<code>and2</code>.  if \((a,b,c,d) = (0,1,1,0)\) it is the truth table for
<code>xor2</code>.  Since there are 4 variables, there are \(2^4=16\)
possible settings of \((a,b,c,d)\) and consequently there are
16 Boolean logic functions that take two arguments.
</p>

<p>
The Sigma16 logic instructions provide all 16 of these
functions; taking a 4-bit code that specifies the logic
function by giving the values of \((a,b,c,d)\).  In assembly
language, the code is given as the decimal number represented
by the bits \((a,b,c,d)\), which is between 0 and 15.  The

<p>
The <code>inv</code> function can be treated as a 2-input function where
the second argument is ignored.
</p>

<p>
Instead of writing the numeric code, we can define symbolic
names for the logic functions we need:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-Sigma16">and  equ     1
or   equ     7
xor  equ     6
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Now, instead of specifying a logic function as (for example)
6, we can write it as <code>xor</code>.

<div id="outline-container-org73d0dec" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org73d0dec"><span class="section-number-4">5.5.2.</span> Logic on fields: logicf</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-5-5-2">
<p>
The logicf instruction performs a bitwise logic operation on
fields within two words.  The fields may be in different
registers, but each field must be at the same position: their
start and end indices must be the same.  Each bit of the
result is obtained by performing a specified logic function
on the corresponding bits of the two fields.  The result
overwrites the field in the first operand register. The
function \(h\) is specified as described above; for example, 6
is the code for exclusive or.
</p>

<p>
The field is specified as a pair of 4-bit constants f, g,
where f is the index of the rightmost bit in the field and g
is the index of the leftmost bit.  Since the rightmost bit
has a lower index, g should be greater than f.  If \(f=g\) then
the field consists of just one bit.  If \(g<f\) then the field
is empty, and the instruction will not change the destination
register.  The notation Rd.f:g means bits f through g in
register Rd.
</p>

<pre class="example" id="orgbd64773">
;    logicf  Rd,Re,f,g,h
;      Rd = first operand register and destination register
;      Re = second operand register

;      g = index of leftmost bit in field (in both registers)
;      h = logic function
;      effect:  Rd.f:g := map2 h (Rd.f:g, Re.f:g)

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-5-5-3">
<p>
Several special cases of <code>logicf</code> appear frequently.  There
are special pseudoinstructions that simplify these special
cases by allowing some of the operands to be omitted.
</p>

<p>
The first simplification is to omit the operand that
specifies the logic function, and instead to indicate the
function in the mnemonic.  For example, suppose you want to
calculate the logical <i>and</i> of two fields.  This can be done
with the general logicf instruction:
</p>

<pre class="example" id="orgfddbb85">
logicf Rd,Re,f,g,1
</pre>

<p>
Alternatively, you can indicate the logic function in the
mnemonic and omit the function operand:
</p>

<pre class="example" id="orgf35e185">
andf Rd,Re,f,g
</pre>

<p>
This simplification can be used with the following four
functions (the comment shows the actual machine instruction
generated by the assembler):
</p>

<pre class="example" id="org89bcbbd">
;    invf   Rd,f,g        ; logicf Rd,R0,f,g,12
;    andf   Rd,Re,f,g     ; logicf Rd,Re,f,g,1
;    orf    Rd,Re,f,g     ; logicf Rd,Re,f,g,2
;    xorf   Rd,Re,f,g     ; logicf Rd,Re,f,g,6
</pre>

<p>
The second simplification is to perform logic on an entire
word, rather than a field within the word.  This is achieved
by specifying \(f=0\) and \(g=15\).  The instruction <code>logicf
Rd,Re,0,15,h</code> applies h bitwise to the entire regisers Rd and
Re, and the result overwrites Rd.  There are
pseudoinstructions to simplify this (which were introduced in
a tutorial section above):
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-Sigma16">invw  R3      ; R3 := invert R3
andw  R3,R4   ; R3 := R3 and R4
orw   R3,R4   ; R3 := R3 or R4
xorw  R3,R4   ; R3 := R3 xor R4
</pre>
</div>

<p>
A pseudoinstruction is not a machine instruction: the Sigma16
processor does not have an <code>andw</code> instruction.  Instead, the
assembler generates the <code>logicf</code> instruction corresponding to
any of <code>invw</code>, <code>andw</code>, <code>orw</code>, <code>xorw</code>.  The following assembly
language statements generate exactly the same machine
language:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-Sigma16">andw    R5,R7          ; R5 := R5 and R7
logicf  R5,R7,0,15,1   ; R5 := R5 and R7
</pre>
</div>

<p>
If you're using one of the most common logic functions, a
pseudoinstruction is convenient and can make a program more
readable.  If you prefer to use the actual machine
instruction, rather than a pseudoinstruction, you can define
a symbol for the logic function using an <code>equ</code> assembly
directive.  The symbol can then be used instead of the
numeric code:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-Sigma16">xor  equ   6
     ...
     logicf R5,R7,R2,xor   ; R5 := R7 xor R2
</pre>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-org54f4255" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org54f4255"><span class="section-number-4">5.5.4.</span> Bit logic: logicb</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-5-5-4">
<p>
The bit logic instruction <code>logicb</code> specifies two operand
bits, which may be in any register at any index.  It applies
a specified logic function to these bits and puts the result
bit back into the first operand, overwriting the previous
value of that bit.  The other bits in the first operand
register remain unchanged.  As this instruction modifies only
one bit in the first operand, it enables you to keep many
Boolean variables in just one register.
</p>

<p>
The general form is:
</p>

<pre class="example" id="orgb1f68b9">
;    logicb  Rd,Re,f,g,h
;      effect: Rd.f := h (Rd.f, Re.g)
;      format: EXP
;      machine language: Ed01 efgh (op=E ab=01)
     logicb  R7,R9,3,5,6    ; e701 9356
</pre>

<p>
Suppose you want to calculate the logical xor of the bit in
R3 at index 12 and the bit in R7 at index 14.  This
instruction will do it (provided that the symbol xor is
defined to be 6), The result will overwrite the bit in R3 at
index 12:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-Sigma16">logicb  R3,R7,12,14,xor  ; R3.12 := R3.12 xor R7.14
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Example:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-Sigma16">lea    R2,$0f00[R0]   ; R2.9 := 1

functions:
</p>

</div>

<p>
The <code>logicf</code> instruction and its pseudoinstructions (<code>andf</code>, etc.) can
operate on fields of any size, including 1-bit fields.  However,
<code>logicb</code> and its pseudoinstructions are more flexible than <code>logicf</code> on
a 1-bit field, because <code>logicb</code> allows the operands to have different
bit indices.

The extract instruction copies a field within a register to

source register are unchanged.
</p>

<p>
These instructions are useful for systems programming.
Emulators need to access instruction fields, software
implementing floating point needs to access the parts of a
floating point number, and networking software needs to
decode message headers.

<p>
<b>Bit indexing.</b> Sigma16 indexes bit positions in a word from
right to left, starting from 0.  The least significant
(rightmost) bit has index 0, and the most significant
(leftmost) bit has index 15.
</p>

<p>
A bit field is a sequence of bits within a word.  A field is
specified using a pair of 4-bit natural numbers \(L,R\), where
\(L\) is the index of the leftmost bit in the field and \(R\) is
the index of the rightmost bit.  The size of a field is \(\max
(0, L-R+1)\). Consequently, if \(L < R\) the size is 0. For
example:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>R8.6,4 is the field consisting of R8.6, R8.5, R8.4 and its
size is 3.</li>
<li>R8.11,11 is the field consisting of R8.11 and its size
is 1.</li>
<li>R8.15,0 is the field containing the entire contents of R8
and its size is 16.</li>
<li>R8.5,7 is an empty field containing no bits; its size is 0</li>
</ul>

<li>op  = $e (escape to EXP)</li>
<li>Rd  = destination register</li>
<li>ab  = secondary opcode: $05 for extract</li>
<li>Re  = source register</li>
<li>f   = destination start index L</li>
<li>g   = destination end index R</li>
<li>h   = source start index L</li>
</ul>

<p>
The instruction specifies the destination field as \(f,g\).
The field size S and the R index for the source are not
specified in the instruction: only the leftmost index of the
source field is specified explicitly as \(h\).
</p>

<p>
The sizes of the source and destination fields must be the
same.  The size and right index of the source are calculated
as follows.  The calculations verify that both the source and
destination fields have the same size.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The size \(S\) of a field specified by \(L,R\) is \(\max (0,
  L-R+1)\).</li>
<li>In general, \(R = L - S + 1\).</li>
<li>Destination field = Rd.f, Rd.f-1, &#x2026;, Rd.g.</li>
<li>Check that this works for destination: R = L - S + 1 = f -
(f-g+1) + 1 = f - f + g - 1 + 1 = g.</li>
<li>Source field = Re.h, Re.h-1, &#x2026;, Re.h-f+g</li>
<li>Calculate \(R\) for source, which is not specified in the
instruction.  R = L - S + 1 = h - (f-g+1) + 1 = h - f + g -
1 + 1 = h - f + g.</li>
</ul>

<p>
<b>Assembly language.</b> The assembly language operand format for
extract is RkkRk, where R denotes a register number and k
denotes a 4-bit constant.  The general form of the
instruction, in assembly language, is
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-Sigma16">extract Rd,f,g,Re,h
</pre>
</div>

<p>
<b>Effect.</b> The effect is to overwrite each bit in the
destination field with the corresponding bit in the source
field:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-Sigma16">Rd.f := Re.h
Rd.f-1 := Re.h-1
...
Rd.g := Re.h-f+g
</pre>
</div>

<p>
For example, consider <code>extract R14,9,7,R13,5</code>, where \(f=9\),
\(g=7\), \(h=5\).  The field size is \(f-g+1 = 9-7+1 = 3\), so 3
bit assignments take place.  The index of the rightmost bit
in the source field = \(h-f+g = 5 -9 + 7 = 3\).  Therefore the
instruction performs the following bit assignments:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-Sigma16">R14.9 := R13.5
R14.8 := R13.4
R14.7 := R13.3
</pre>
</div>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-Sigma16">; Assembly language: extract Rd,f,g,Re,h
; Effect:            Rd.f..g := Re.h..(h+g-f)
; EXP opcode:        e,15

; Example:           extract R2,11,8,R1,3
; Machine language:  e215 1b83
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Example:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-Sigma16">extract R2,7,4,R3,20
R2.7 := R3.20
R2.6 := R3.19
R2.5 := R3.18
R2.4 := R3.17
</pre>
</div>

<p>
The extract instruction can be implemented using a
combination of logic and shift instructions. It is included
in the architecture for several reasons:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>extract provides useful abstractions for writing
interpreters and simulators.</li>
<li>When used in an interpreter, bit field operations are
executed frequently: they are a crucial part of the "inner
loop".  Therefore the efficiency of common bit field
operations is important.</li>
<li>The bit field instructions are easier to use and more
readable than the corresponding logic and shifts.</li>
<li>This instruction can be implemented efficiently in a digital
circuit and this implementation is an interesting design problem.</li>
</ul>

<p>
The effect of an extract instruction can be described by
writing each bit assignment individually, so there are <i>size</i>
individual bit assignments.  The notation R2.7 means <i>the bit
at position 7 in register R2</i>.  Using this notation, the
example above performs the following bit assignments:
</p>

<table border="2" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6" rules="groups" frame="hsides">


<colgroup>
<col  class="org-left" />
</colgroup>
<thead>

<th scope="col" class="org-left">extract R2,R1,11,3,4</th>

</tr>

<tr>
<td class="org-left">R2.9 := R1.1</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class="org-left">R2.8 := R1.0</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>
<b>Relation to other instructions.</b> Although extract performs a
number of bit assignments, it is a single instruction and its
execution time is a small fixed number of clock cycles.  The
execution time does not depend on the value of the field
size, and extracting a large field doesn't require more time
than extracting a small field. The hardware implementation of
the instruction does not use an iteration to copy the bits;
they are all copied in parallel in one clock cycle.
</p>

<p>
Any register may be specified for the source and destination.
If they are the same, the effect is to move a bit field from
one place to another within the register (this is not the
same as a shift).  If the destination is R0, the result is
discarded and the instruction has no effect.
</p>

These instructions can be implemented using a combination of
logic and shift instructions.  They are included in the
architecture for several reasons:

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-sec-assembly-language">
<p>
A computer is a digital circuit that executes programs in
machine language, which is hard for humans to read because it
consists entirely of numbers.  Assembly language provides a
readable notation for writing machine language programs.  It
uses names for instructions and variables, as well as other
notations to make the code easier to understand.
</p>

<p>
An instruction in machine language is just one or more words
(often written in hexadecimal notation), while the
corresponding instruction in assembly language uses mnemonic
names so the programmer doesn't have to memorise all the
operation codes, addresses of variables, and so on. For
example, the assembly language statement mul R12,R3,R8 is
more readable than the corresponding machine language
instruction 2c38.  However, the assembly language still gives
the programmer complete control over every bit a program.
</p>

<p>
A programmer writes a machine-level program in assembly
language.  A software application called the <b>assembler</b>
reads it in and translates it to machine language.  When it
sees an instruction mnemonic like add or div, it replaces it
with the operation code (0, 3, or whatever).  The assembler
helps with variable names &#x2014; the machine language needs
addresses (numbers) and the assembler calculates them
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>You can use names (add, div) rather than numeric codes
(0, 3)</li>
<li>You can use variable names (x, y, sum) rather than memory
addresses (02c3, 18d2)</li>
<li>You write a program in assemply language</li>
<li>The assembler translates it into machine language</li>
</ul>

<p>
Compilers and assemblers are similar in some ways: both of
them translate a program from one language to another.  The
main difference is that compilers translate between languages
that are quite different, while assemblers translate between
similar languages.

Sigma16 has the flexibility required for "programming in the
large".  It provides modules, separate assembly, import and
export, relocation, linking, executables, and booting.  It
also has special conventions that enable the user to skip
those complications, and simply enter a standalone program,
assemble it, and run it.  The system is straightforward for
beginners but allows a transition to realistic systems
programming.
</p>

<p>
The assembler inputs a program in assembly language.  This is
called the <i>source module</i>.  The assembler outputs an <i>object
module</i> that contains the machine language code.  The
assembler also produces an <i>assembly listing</i>, which presents
the program in a form useful for the programmer.  The
assembly listing shows the source code, the corresponding
machine language, a symbol table, and any error messages.
Finally, the assembler outputs a <i>metadata module</i> that
enables the emulator to track the source statement
corresponding to each instruction.
</p>

<p>
A simple program consists of just one source module that does
not import anything.  This is a <i>standalone program</i>, and
assembling it produces an <i>executable program</i>.  An
executable program is an object module that does not require
linking; it can be booted directly in the processor.
</p>

<p>
A larger program may consist of several source modules,
including one main program.  This requires use of the
<i>linker</i> to combine the collection of object modules into a
single executable program.

If a program consists of just one source module that does not
import any names, it is <i>standalone</i>.  There are several ways
to input a standalone program: you can choose it from one of
the examples, load it from a file, or type it into the
editor.  In all cases, the text of the program is shown in
the editor pane.  Go to the Assembler pane and click
Assemble.  If there are no errors, go directly to the
Processor pane (you can skip the Linker) and click Boot.
This will read the machine language into the memory, and now
you can run the program.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-7-1-2">
<p>
Large programs are easier to develop if you break them into
separate modules which can be assembled separately.  One of
the modules is identified as the <i>main module</i>, and it
imports the other modules.  This allows you to define
procedures, global variables, and symbolic constants in
separate modules.  Many separate programs can reuse these
modules simply by importing them.
</p>

<p>
The Sigma16 app maintains a <i>Module Set</i> describing all the
modules that it knows about.  The usual workflow is to read
in all the modules comprising a program, and to assemble each
of them.  Then the linker combines all the modules in the
Module Set to form an executable.  The executable can be
saved to a file, or it can be booted into the processor.
</p>

<p>
The Module Set is displayed in the <i>Modules</i> page.  Key
information about each module is shown, including the first
few lines of the source code.  It is good practice to begin
every source module with two or three lines of comments that
identify the code, giving its name, purpose, author, and
date.
</p>

<p>
The app maintains several invariants:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>At all times, there is at least one module.  If you close
the last remaining module, a new one with empty source code
is immediately created, to ensure that there is at least
one module.</li>

<li>At all times, exactly one module is <i>selected</i>.  The
assembler always works on the selected module. When you go
to the Assemble page, the assembler source code is set to
the text of the selected module.</li>

<li>At all times, the source code text of the selected module
is displayed in the editor window.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Each module in the Module Set has a <i>module record</i> that
contains everything the app knows about the module:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>(optional) the name of the module</li>

<li>(always) the source code (which could just be an empty or
blank string)</li>

<li>(optional) the filename and file handle of the source code</li>

<li>(if there is a file handle) whether the code in the file is
<i>stale</i> (i.e.  the current source code has been edited and
differs from the text in the file)</li>

<li>(after assembly) the object code. Each module has an
associated object code, which may be empty. The object code
can be produced by a successful assembly (i.e. an assembly
with no errors) or it can be obtained from the Editor.
This allows object code to be read from a file or entered
directly by the user.</li>

whether the file should be saved.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>New &#x2013; Check whether text in the editor buffer has been

editor buffer.</li>

<li>Open &#x2013; Check whether text in the editor buffer has been
saved; if not, ask whether to save it.  Enter the open file
dialogue where an existing file can be found by navigation
or by typing in its name.  If the dialogue is cancelled,
the module set and editor buffer are left unchanged.  If a
file is selected in the dialogue, and it is already in the
module set, then it is selected in the current module.
Otherwise, a new module is created with the file's
contents, and is selected as the current module.  and The
file is loaded into the editor buffer and added to the

<li>Refresh &#x2013; The file corresponding to the current module is
read, and its contents are loaded into the editor buffer.</li>

<li>SaveAs &#x2013; Enters the save file dialogue where the directory
and file name can be chosen.  The editor buffer is written
into this file.</li>

<li>Save &#x2013; Writes the editor buffer into the current file and
directory.  If either the module name or directory is not
known, this reverts to a SaveAs.</li>

<li>Select &#x2013; Opens a list of all modules; you can click one of
them which is then set as the current module.</li>

<li>Close &#x2013; Check whether text in the editor buffer has been
saved; if not, ask whether to save it. The module is
removed from the module set, and the editor buffer is
cleared.  The first module (module number 0) is selected as
the current module, but if there is no module at all, an

A source module may be stored in a file, although this is not
required.  The assembler will produce several objects, which
can also be stored into files.
</p>

<p>
There is a standard convention for Sigma16 filenames.  All
filenames end with a two-part extension, such as <code>.asm.txt</code>.
The first part (<code>.asm</code>) tells Sigma16 what kind of
information the file contains, and the final part (<code>.txt</code>)
enables the computer you're running on to interpret the file
as plain text.  If you have a program named <code>MyProgram</code>, then
the files associated with it must be named as follows:

<p>
The first part of the filename (<code>MyProgram</code>) is the <i>base
name</i>, and is the same for all the files for the module.  The
last part (<code>.asm.txt</code>) is the <i>extension</i>.
</p>

<p>
A filename can be specified either as a full path (the unique
identification of the file (<code>C:\\Users\...\prog.asm.txt</code>), or
as just a filename (myprogram.asm.txt) which is relative to
the current directory.
</p>

<p>
To edit a file, the modDir and modName are both optional.  An
edited file may have a module name specified with a module
statement.  To read or save a file, both the module directory
and name must be known.
</p>

<p>
There are two ways to read in a file:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Go to the <i>Examples</i> page, navigate to one of the examples,
and open it.  This will create a new module record and read
the <code>.asm.txt</code> file into the source code for that record.

record are set to the empty string.</li>

<li>Go to the <i>Modules</i> page, click <i>Choose File</i>, and navigate

An expression can do arithmetic on a local label, but not on
an imported name.  The reason is that arithmetic requires
that the value of the name is known.  That's why an
expression like a equ rcd+5 can be used only after the label
rcd is defined: it enables the value of each name to be
calculated during pass 1.  But the values of imported names
are not known at all during assembly; they become defined
only during linking.  Such a value can affect the values of
words in the object code, but not their locations.
</p>

<p>
An expression is assembly language syntax that, when
evaluated, denotes a value (i.e. a 16-bit word).  Evaluation
takes place entirely at assembly time.  Expressions may be
labels, constants, or may be calculated.

When an instruction word or data word is generated, its

The org directive specifies a new value of the location

A machine language program consists of words stored in memory
at particular addresses.  A word is just a collection of 16
bits; it has no type.
</p>

<p>
An assembly language program specifies all the words that
comprise a program.  In principle you could just write out
all the words as numbers, but this is difficult and prone to
errors.  Thw whole point of assembly language is to provide
notations that make it easier to specify these numbers, while
retaining total control&#x2014;every single bit in the object code
is determined by the assembly language.
</p>

<p>
A <b>value</b> is a word of 16 bits.  Values do not have types;
their type depends entirely on usage.  Values may be used in
generating object code, either as the displacment field of an
RX instruction or as the operand of a data statement.
</p>

<p>
Every value is either <b>fixed</b> or <b>relocatable</b>.  If a module
is linked, then its relocatable values may be translated, but
the fixed values remain unchanged.

<p>
Each line of source code is an assembly language statement.
Unlike higher level languages, assembly language statements
are not nested.  There are three kinds of assembly language
statement:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><i>Comments</i> (blank lines, or lines beginning with ;)</li>
<li><i>Code</i> statements define instructions or constant data</li>
<li>/Directives provide metadata but don't generate any code</li>
</ul>

<p>
An assembly language statement contains one or more fields.
A field consists of non-space characters (with one exception:
a space may appear in a string literal).  Fields are
separated from each other by one or more white space
characters.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Label.  The label field is optional.  If present, the label
must be a name and it must begin in the first character of
the line.  If the first character is a space, then that
line has no label.</li>

<li>Operation.  The operation field is an identifier that
specifies an instruction or assembler directive.  It must
be preceded by one or more white space characters.  Every
statement (apart from a full line comment) must have an
operation field.</li>

<li>Operands.  The operands field specifies operands for an
instruction or arguments for assembly directives.  There
may be several operands, which must be separated by commas.
Each type of statement (determined by the operation field)
requires a specific syntax for the operands.  Most
instructions and assembler directives require operands, but
some do not.</li>

<li>Comment.  All text that either (1) follows white space
after the operands field, or (2) follows a semicolon (;),
is a comment, and is ignored by the assembler.  If one or
more of the other fields (label, operation, operands) is
missing, the comment must be preceded by a semicolon to
prevent it from being interpreted as operands.  The rule
is: all text after a semicolon is a comment, and all text
after white space following operands is a comment.  A
statement where the first non-space character is a
semicolon is a full line comment.  If the statement has no
operands, then all text after the operation field is a
comment.  It is good practice always to begin a comment
with a semicolon.</li>

<div id="outline-container-org877e839" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org877e839"><span class="section-number-4">7.3.1.</span> Instructions</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-7-3-1">
<p>
Assembly language statements generally correspond to the
instruction formats, but there is not an exact correspondence
for several reasons:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Sometimes an instruction is written in assembly language
with a field omitted which exists in the machine language
code but is ignored.  For example, the instruction <b>cmp
R1,R2</b> generates an RRR instruction, but the third operand
field is omitted because the instruction requires only one
operand, not two.  The assembler sets the unused operand to
0, but the machine ignores it.  This is called a "don't
care" field in the instruction.</li>

<li>Sometimes two instructions look the same in assembly
language but use different machine language instruction
formats.  For example, <b>add R1,R2,R3</b> and <b>push R1,R2,R3</b>
look similar, but <b>add</b> uses the RRR instruction format and
<b>push</b> uses the EXP instruction format.  The reason for
this is that there are not enough bits in the op field to
accommodate all the instructions with three register
operands, so an <b>expanding opcode</b> is used.  Thus push is
represented with op=14, indicating EXP format, and the EXP
variant is used for this instruction.</li>

<li>The 4-bit fields are sometimes used to denote a register
from the register file (R3), or a control register (mask),
or a constant .  In assembly language the constants are
written just as a number (e.g. shiftl R1,R2,5).  Control
registers are written by name rather than their number in
the control register file (e.g. getctl R3,mask).</li>

<li>Some assembly language statements are <b>pseudoinstructions</b>.
These are special cases of more general instructions.  For
example, <b>and</b> is a pseudoinstruction which generates a
<b>logicf</b> instruction specialised to perform a logical and.</li>

<p>
An EXP instruction may use the fields op, d, ab, e, f, g, h.
The g and h fields can be combined into a single 8-bit field
gh All EXP instructions combine the a and b fields into a
single 8-bit field called ab.  Some EXP instructions combine
the g and h fields into a single 8-bit field called gh.  The
EXP format has the following variants.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The RREXP format takes two register operands, which are in
the e and f fields of the second word. The d field of the
first word and the g and h fields of the second word are
ignored (the assembler will set these to 0).  Any RREXP
instruction could be reprsented as RRR, but there are only
a few RRR opcodes avaiable, so uncommon instructions that
require two registers are represented as RREXP.  Example:
<b>execute R5,R6</b> is RREXP.</li>

<li>The RCEXP format takes two register operands; the first is
a general register and the second is a control register.
An example of the operand field is <b>R3,mask</b>.  The operands
are in the e and f fields of the second word.  The d field
of the first word and the g and h fields of the second word
are ignored (the assembler will set these to 0.)  The first
operand is an element of the register file (for example,
R4).  The second operand is a control register, which is
specified by a 4-bit number.  In assembly language, we
normally refer to the control registers by name rather than
number, to make it easier to remember which is which.  For
example, <b>getctl R3,status</b> has RCEXP format.</li>

<li>The RRREXP format takes three register operands, which are
in the f, g, and h fields of the second word. An example of
the operand field is $R1,R2,R3*.  The d field of the first
word and the e field of the second word are ignored (the
assembler will set these to 0).  The RRREXP instructions
would be a natural fit for the RRR format, but there are
not enough RRR opcodes available, so the EXP format is used
to expand the number of instructions that can be
represented.  For example, <b>push R5,R8,R9</b> has RRREXP
format.</li>

<li>The RRKEXP format takes two register operands and a 4-bit
constant number.  An example of the operand field is
<b>R1,R2,13</b>.  The register operands are in the f and g
fields of the second word, and constant is in the h field
of the second word.  The d field of the first word and the
e field of the second word are ignored (the assembler sets
these to 0).  For example, <b>shiftr R3,R6,7</b> has RRKEXP
format.</li>

<li>The RRKKEXP format takes two register operands and two
4-bit constant binary number operands.  The register
operands are in the e and f fields of the second word,
while the two constants are in the g and h fields.  The d
field of the first word is ignored (the assembler sets it
to 0).</li>

<li>The RRXEXP format takes two register operands as well as a
memory address specified with an 8-bit offset and index
register.  Thus these instructions require three registers
to be specified, as well as the offset.  Thus every bit of
both instruction words is needed to represent an RRXEXP
format instruction.  In assembly language, the memory
address is written as <b>offset[Rh]</b> where <b>offset</b> is an
-bit binary number and Rh is a register.  The effective
memory address is <b>offset+Rh</b>. This is similar to ordinary
memory addresses; the only difference is that it uses an
8-bit offset rather than a 16-bit displacement. For
example, <b>save R1,R9,2[R14]</b> has RRKEXP format.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Expressions, values and relocatables
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>An expression is syntax: 23, -5, $b23e, struc+5,
arrEnd-arrStart</li>

<li>A value denotes a word (it is a number) and is the result
of evaluating an expression</li>

<li>A value is marked as either relocatable or fixed</li>

<li>Expressions may occur in
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Displacement field of an assembly language statement; the
value of the expression is placed in the displacement
field of the corresponding machine language instruction.</li>
<li>If a displacement value is relocatable, its address is
recorded in the list of addressess of words to be
relocated</li>
<li>Right hand side of an equ statement.  The value may be
fixed or relocatable.  The name (the left hand side) is
defined as a new identifier, the definition line is the
line containing the equ, the value is the evaluation of
the right hand side, which may be either fixed or
relocatable.  Identifiers used in the expression on the
RHS have the line number included in their usage lines.</li>
<li>But identifiers that appear in an expression (even if
relocatable) are not recorded in the relocation list;
only displacements are placed in the relocation list.</li>

<p>
The following sections describe the instructions in groups
organized by their function.  Some of the groups contain
instructions with different formats.  From the programmer's
perspective the function is more important, so these groups
are useful in finding the right instruction to use.  (From
the perspective of designing a digital circuit to impleemnt
the architecture, the format is essential.)

The data statement specifies a sequence of constants to be
placed in consecutive memory locations starting at the
location counter, subject to relocation.  Its argument is a
list of one or more 4-digit hex constants separated by
commas.
</p>

<p>
A long block of data can be broken up into several data
statements.  Suppose x1, x2, etc are 4-digit hex constants.
Then
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-Sigma16">data  x1,x2,x3,x4,x5,x6

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The module's relocation constant is r</li>
<li>The location counter has been set to c</li>
<li>The i'th constant (counting from 0) in a data statement is
x.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Then the linker will set mem[r+c+i] := x.
</p>

<p>
One point to watch out for is that an assembly language data
statement uses $ to indicate that a number is a hex constant
(e.g. $03b7) but the object language data statement requires
all numbers to be 4-digit hex constants, and does not require
(or allow) a preceding $ character

<h4 id="org688996c"><span class="section-number-4">7.4.1.</span> module</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-7-4-1">
<p>
A program may be organized as a collection of modules, where
each module appears in a separate file.  When several modules
are present, each one needs a unique name.  The <i>module</i>
statement declares the name of the module, which is specified
in the label field.  There are no operands.  The following
statement says that this is the object code for module named
<i>abc</i>:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-Sigma16">abc   module 
</pre>
</div>

<p>
A <i>module</i> statement is optional.  If none is present in a
file, the module is anonymous.  If a file does contain a
<i>module</i> statement, it must be the first statement in the
file, although it may be preceded by comments and blank
lines.  It is illegal for a file to contain more than one
<i>module</i> statement.
</p>

<p>
An anonymous module can import other modules, but other
modules cannot import anything exported from an anonymous
module.  This means, in effect, that an anonymous module is
useful only as a main program.
</p>

<p>
It is good practice for the main program to have a module
statement; in effect, this is the name of the program as well
as the name of the module.
</p>

<p>
An assembly language file should have a name of the form
basename.asm.txt.  If there is a module statement <i>modname
module</i>, then basename should be <i>modname</i>.  For example, the
file Heapsort.asm.txt might contain the statement <i>Heapsort
module</i>.  If there is no module statement, basename is
arbitrary.

<h4 id="orgf9dec78"><span class="section-number-4">7.4.2.</span> import</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-7-4-2">
<p>
The import statement states that the value of an identifier
is defined in another module.  During the assembly of the
module containing the import, the identifier is given a
provisional value of 0, but this will be replaced by the
actual value by the linker.  For example,
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-Sigma16">x   import  Mod1,x
y   import  Mod1,abc
</pre>
</div>

<p>
says that x is a name that can be used in this module, but it
is defined in Mod1; y can be used in this module but it is
defined in Mod1 under the name abc.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-org7c631a2" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org7c631a2"><span class="section-number-4">7.4.3.</span> export</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-7-4-3">
<p>
An export statement says that the module is making the value
of a symbol available for use in other modules, which may
import it.  The statement takes two operands: the name being
exported and the value, which must be a 4-digit hex constant.
It makes no difference whether the name is relocatable, as
the linker performs any relocation before writing the
exported value into other modules that import it.  Examples:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-Sigma16">export  haltcode,0
export  fcn,002c
</pre>
</div>

<p>
The export statement states that the value of an identifier
should be made available for other modules to import.  For
example, this module defines a function and exports it so
other modules can import and call it:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-Sigma16">Mod1     module
         export fcn

fcn      add    R1,R1,R1

<h3 id="orga6a00a3"><span class="section-number-3">7.5.</span> Assembly listing</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-7-5">
<p>
The first section of the assembly listing shows each line of
the source program.  The line number appears first, followed
by the memory address that the instruction on this line will
be placed in.  The address is given as a 4 digit hexadecimal
number, and it is binary (not two's complement).  Next comes
the machine language code generated by the line of source
code.  If the line contains a two-word instruction, there
will be two 4-digit hexadecimal values; for a one-word
instruction there will be one hex number, and if the line
doesn't produce any code these fields will be blank.  After
the code, the original source statement appears.
</p>

<p>
The second section of the assembly listing is the <b>Symbol
Table</b>.  This shows each identifier (or "symbol") that
appears in the program, the address allocated for the symbol,
the source code line where it was defined, and the source
code lines where it was used.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-7-5-2">
<p>
The <code>reserve</code> statement has one operand, which is a numeric
constant.  The assembler increments the location counter by
the value of the operand.
</p>

<p>
This can be used to reserve a block of memory, for example to
hold a stack or heap data structure.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-Sigma16">asize   equ    100
n       reserve asize
</pre>
</div>

<p>
If the operand of a <code>reserve</code> statement is a symbol defined
by an <code>equ</code>, that definition must precede the <code>reserve</code>
statement.  This is because pass 1 of the assembler needs to
calculate the address of each code word, and an <code>equ</code> that
follows the <code>reserve</code> statement would not become known until
after the size of the <code>reserve</code> is needed.

<h2 id="sec-linker"><span class="section-number-2">8.</span> Object code and linker</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-sec-linker">
<p>
Small programs often consist of just one module (or file).
The assembler translates the assembly language source code
into machine language which is then executed by the
processor.
</p>

<p>
However, there are several reasons for breaking up larger
programs into several modules.  It's easier to work with
several modules of reasonable size rather than one gigantic
file.  A module may provide generic services that can be
incorporated into many programs.  Programs can be simplified
if they use libraries for common tasks, rather than
implementing everything from scratch.  It is faster to
assemble small files than large ones.
</p>

<p>
When a program consists of several modules, each one can be
assembled separately.  However, the resulting machine
language is not executable if it refers to procedures or
other values defined in another module.  An instruction in
module A cannot refer to a word X in module B unless it knows
the address of X, and when module A is assembled it knows
nothing about module B.
</p>

<p>
To produce an executable program, its modules need to be
combined into a single executable module, with all the
addresses resolved.  This is called <b>linking</b>.
</p>

<p>
Sigma16 supports linking.  The system is designed so that
programs that consist of just one standalone module can be
executed directly, without linking.  This means you can
ignore the issues of modules and linking if you just want to
write a andalone program.

The object language has a simple syntax and only a few types
of statement.  Each object statement is written on one line.
It begins with a keyword indicating the type of statement,
followed by one or more spaces, followed by an operand field

a comma-separated list of tokens; each token is either a hex
constant or an identifier.

characters, using digits 0-9 a-f.  Unlike assembly
language, a hex constant is not preceded by $.  There is no
need for this, as all numbers are written in hex in object
code.  Assembly language allows both hex and decimal
numbers so there needs to be a way to tell them apart.</li>

<li>Identifiers have the same syntax as in assembly language: a
string of letters, digits, and underscore characters,

<p>
The object language has seven statements: <code>module</code>, <code>org</code>,
<code>data</code>, <code>import</code>, <code>export</code>, and <code>relocate</code>.  Some of these
are related to corresponding statements in assembly language,
but their syntax is different and in some cases they may
contain different information.

<h3 id="org7f4729e"><span class="section-number-3">8.2.</span> Module metadata</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-8-2">
<p>
The assembler and linker create metadata files which enable
the emulator to show the assembly language statement
corresponding to the instruction currently being executed.
The metadata is not part of the machine language, and the
emulator doesn't look at it in order to execute the program.
It is entirely optional: the emulator can run a program
without any metadata, although without it the emulator cannot
display the current assembly language source statement.  This
section explains how the metadata works and the format of the
files.
</p>

<p>
The emulator attempts to show the assembly language source as
the program runs, and it highlights the current and next
instruction.  To do this, the emulator needs to have some
information that isn't present in the object code.  This
extra information is supplied in a separate metadata file
produced by the assembler and the linker.
</p>

<p>
An object file foo.obj.txt may have a corresponding metadata
file foo.omd.txt ("object metadata").  An executable file
foo.exe.txt may have a corresponding metadata file
foo.xmd.txt ("executable metadata").  The format of the
metadata is identical for object and executable; the reason
for the distinction is that the user might have a program
with main program foo.asm.txt, and later give the executable
the same name foo.  In that case, there will be separate
metadata files for the object and the executable.
</p>

<p>
The metadata contains the source code in two forms: plain
text and with html tags for highlighting the fields.  In
addition, the metadata contains a mapping from address to
source code line number.
</p>

<p>
The metadata file format is parsed in order to populate
several data structures that enable the emulator to The
metadata contains the lines of text of the assembly listing.
These lines contain the address, the object code at that
address, and the assembly language source statement.  Each
line of the assembly listing appears t The emulator displays
most lines of the assembly listing with the same field
highlighting
</p>

<p>
A metadata file contains two sections: the ASmap followed by
the source listing text.  A metadata file must have the
following contents:
</p>

<p>
$a0,s0,a1,s1,$ $a2,s2, &#x2026;,$ \(a_{n-1},s_{n-1}\)
</p>

<p>
When the pc contains address \(a_i\) then the source statement
\(s_i\) should be displayed.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><code>fsmap</code> <i>n</i></li>
<li>comma separated list of <i>n</i> numbers, which may be split
into lines</li>
<li><code>source</code> <i>n</i></li>
<li><i>n</i> lines of html giving the assembly listing.  Each line
appears twice: first a "plain" form, followed by a
"decorated" form that contains html span elements for
highlighting the fields of the text</li>
</ul>

An executable module is written in the same language as
object modules.  The only difference is that an executable
module must contain only these types of statement: module,
data, org.  It is now allowed to contain any of the
following statments: import, export, relocate.
</p>

<p>
If an assembly language program doesn't contain any import
or export directives, then its object code won't contain
any import, export, or relcate statements.  In this case,
the object code is already executable and does not require
linking: it can be booted directly by the processor.
</p>

<p>
The booter (invoked by clicking the Boot button in the
processor page) reads in the currently selected module and
checks to see whether it is a valid executable module.  If
so, it loads the code into the memory.  If not, it
indicates that the program cannot be booted.

The extract instruction is not essential: it can be performed

a field mask that can be used with logic instructions for a
variety of purposes.

<p>
The statement-by-statement style: Each statement is compiled
independently.  The pattern is: load, arithmetic, store.
Straightforward but inefficient.
</p>

<p>
The register-variable style: Keep variables in registers
across a group of statements.  Don't need as many loads and
stores.  More efficient.  You have to keep track of whether
variables are in memory or a register.  Use comments to show
register usage.  Real compilers use this style.  Use this
style if you like the shorter code it produces.

<p>
A common usage of save and restore is to simplify procedure
call and return.  When a procedure is called, store the
registers onto the execution stack when a procedure is called
(using save), and then to load them back from the stack when
the procedure is returned (restore).  Normally, the format of
a stack frame has a fixed location for saving the registers,
at a small offset from the beginning of the frame.  A
register called the <i>stack pointer</i> gives the address of the
frame, and the offset for saving the registers is normally a
small value (such as 3 or similar).

A testset instruction is not semantically equivalent to a
load followed by a store.  Consider this example:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-Sigma16">; (1) testset
     testset   R1,mutex[R0]

<p>
The essential difference is that (1) executes as an atomic
operation, but (2) does not, and this could lead to errors in
mutual exclusion, which could lead in turn to fatal errors,
crashes, and security violations.
</p>

<p>
Consider, for example, a situation where two processes are
sharing mutex to control access to a critical retion.
</p>

<p>
  an interrupt could occor after the load and before the
store.  Suppose, for example, that initially mutex = 0 and
the sequence is executed.  Another process could be
performing a similar sequence of instructions on the same
mutex variable.

A breakpoint is the address of an instruction; when the

enabling the programmer to examine the state of registers and
memory.  To set a breakpoint, click Breakpoint and enter the
instruction address you want to stop at in the dialogue box.
There are several control buttons.  Refresh means "read the
contents of the text in the box, which must be a $ followed
by a 4 hex digit address".  Whenever you change the text, you
should click Refresh.  The Enable button toggles the
breakpoint on and off.  The Close button hides the Breakpoint
dialogue box.  Here's an example.  Suppose you want to stop
execution of a program at address 00f6:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Click Breakpoint</li>
<li>Enter $00f6</li>
<li>Click Refresh</li>

<p>
The execution will run until the pc becomes equal to 00f6 and
will then stop.

<p>
Click Refresh, then Enable, then Close.  Then click Run, and
the emulator will run at full speed until the pc reaches the

Sigma16 also contains some advanced features that use the
command line in a shell.  These features include text
commands for assembling and linking programs, and for running
the circuit simulator.  These features require some software
installation.  In addition, building Sigma16 from soure
requires some additional software that must be installed.
All of the software required is free and open source, and all
of it runs on Windows, Macintosh, and Gnu/Linux.

<p>
Version 3.2 brings several changes that will be visible to
users of previous versions of Sigma16:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><i>cmplt, cmpeq, cmpgt are removed.</i> Instead, use the <code>cmp</code>
instruction, which sets the condition code (<code>R15</code>), and
then use any of the conditional jump instructions <code>jumplt</code>,
<code>jumple</code>, <code>jumpeq</code>, <code>jumpne</code>, <code>jumpge</code>, <code>jumpgt</code>.
(Rationale: There are more Booleans in the condition code
than just less-than, equal, and greater-than.  The new
style accomodates all the conditions in a uniform manner,
but the old style does not.  Version 3.1 already supported
<code>cmp</code> and the conditional jumps.)  Here's an example:</li>
</ul>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-Sigma16">; Old style -- these instructions have been removed
     cmplt   R1,R2,R3      ; R1 := R2 &lt; R3
     jumpt   R1,loop[R0]   ; if R2 &lt; R3 then goto loop
; New style -- use the following instead
     cmp     R2,R3         ; compare R2 with R3
     jumplt  loop[R0]      ; if R2 &lt; R3 then goto loop
</pre>
</div>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><i>jumpf is renamed to jumpz, and jumpt is renamed to
jumpnz.</i> The new names stand for <i>jump if zero</i> and <i>jump
if not zero</i>.  Most old programs will use <code>jumpf</code> or
<code>jumpt</code> only after <code>cmplt</code>, <code>cmpeq</code>, or <code>cmpgt</code>, but
following <code>cmp</code> you should use one of the conditional jumps
listed above. (Rationale: The new names reflect more
accurately what the instructions do.  The decision about
whether to jump depends on whether the entire register
contains 0; it isn't a decision based on checking just a
single bit.)</li>
</ul>

<p>
The following changes do not require modifying old programs;
they just relax the syntax rules so some programs would no
longer give an error message.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><i>[R0] is optional.</i> In previous versions of Sigma16, every
displacement requires the index register to be stated
explicitly, even if it's <code>R0</code>: for example, <code>load
  R3,xyz[R0]</code>.  Now, the <code>[R0]</code> can be omitted, although you
can include it if you wish.  Thus <code>load R3,xyz</code> and <code>load
  R3,xyz[R0]</code> are equivalent.  (Rationale: The reason for
requiring <code>[R0]</code> in the past was to emphasise the
regularity of the instruction representation.  However, a
primary aim of the design of Sigma16 is to provide
subsetting of the architecture, which supports a spiral
approach to learning computer architecture.  Another aim is
to provide a good platform for schools or other students
who will just learn a little of the system.  Removing the
requirement for <code>[R0]</code> simplifies the language for a
beginner.  Furthermore, for an experienced expert
programmer it's more readable to omit the <code>[R0]</code> as this
reduces the amount of clutter in the code.)</li>

<li><i>Allow lower case "r" in register names.</i> In previous
versions, elements of the register file required an upper
case <code>R</code>: for example, <code>R8</code>.  Now you can write <code>r8</code> as
well as <code>R8</code>, and both names refer to the same register.
(Of course the same holds for the rest of the register
file.)  This is a trivial syntax issue.  There's no
technical reason to prefer <code>r8</code> or <code>R8</code>; it's just a matter
of personal preference.  It may be easier to read <code>r8</code>
because the lower case <code>r</code> is shorter than the digits.
It's good style to use either the <code>Rn</code> or <code>rn</code> form
consistently, but the assembly language doesn't enforce
that. Labels are case sensitive but registers are not.
Labels are case-sensitive, so <code>xyz</code> and <code>XYZ</code> are distinct
names, but registers are not labels, and registers are not
case sensitive.</li>
</ul>

<p>
There are some changes to the machine language that don't
affect assembly language programs.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Some of the opcodes have changed, so programs need to be
reassembled.</li>

<li>The word logic instructions <code>inv</code>, <code>and</code>, <code>or</code>, <code>xor</code> are
now pseudoinstructions that generate the <code>logicf</code>
instruction.  The assembly language syntax is the same as
before; only the underlying machine language representation
is different</li>
</ul>

<p>
There are some new instructions and features, as well as some
instructions and features that have been in the architecture
for some time but weren't documented in the User Gude.  These
won't affect existing programs.

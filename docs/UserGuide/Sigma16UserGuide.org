# Quick reference: how to build this document
# ----------------------------------------------------------------
#   1. M-x Sigma16 - first load Sigma.el, which is required
#   2. C-u C-c C-x C-u - org-update-all-blocks, update build date
#   3. C-x s (y) - save file
#   4. C-e h h -  export to html
#   5. C-e l l - export to html and tex
# ----------------------------------------------------------------

# ----------------------------------------------------------------
# Building html and pdf
# ----------------------------------------------------------------

# Load Sigma.el.  Before building html, be sure to do M-x Sigma16.
# This will visit the sigma16 source directory and also load
# Sigma.el.

# Update the build date.  This is shown at the very end of the
# document, for both html and latex.  Do C-u C-c C-x C-u which
# updates dynamic blocks.  Then save the file, as the update
# modifies the source org file.

# Build VERSION.txt and VersionMacro.org.
#   cd $SIGMA16
#   make SetVersion

# Build html -  C-c C-e h h
# Build tex  -  C-c C-e l l
# Build pdf via latex -  C-c C-e l p

# Leading space in code.  A code listing won't be indented
# properly if the first character is a space, which is usually the
# case.  To get proper indentation, begin each code fragment with
# a non-space character, which could be a letter (e.g. from a
# label) or a nonbreakable space.  To insert nonbreakable space
# (Unicode hard space), enter: C-x 8 space M-x.  Alternatively,
# insert-character 21D2

# Table of Contents
# --------------------------------------------------------------

# For html, section numbers are distracting, and can be omitted
# with +OPTIONS: num:nil.  For latex, num:nil turns off the table
# of contents.  Is there a way to keep the toc but omit the
# section numbers?

# This turns off section numbering (good) but it also turns off
# the table of contents for tex export (bad, and it isn't supposed
# to do that):

# This numbers levels 1 and 2; html uses bullets for deeper levels
# and latex omits deeper levels from toc
# #+OPTIONS: num:2

# #+OPTIONS: num:nil
# #+OPTIONS: UNNUMBERED:t

# This should keep toc but omit section numbers, but it doesn't work:
#   #+OPTIONS: toc:t num:nil

# Strtegy: <2025-12-20 Sat>
#  - don't use num:nil
#  - For latex, keep section numbering
#  - For html, use css to hide section numbers, and use
#    Sigma16.el to inhibit inclusion of section numbers in
#    the table of contents

#+MACRO: S16Version (Version/Date disabled for section export)

# This is a benign redefinition to prevent error/abort on
# export.  When the entire document is exported, the
# redefinition of S16version (which is included at the top of
# the file) is ignored because of INCLUDING
# ../VersionMacro.org.  (When a macro is defined twice, the
# second definition is ignored.)  When only a section is
# exported, the INCLUDE is skipped, and the second MACRO
# definition prevents an error message (undefined macro) from
# aborting the export.

* Introduction
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: sec-welcome
:END:

Sigma16 is a computer architecture designed for research and
teaching in computer systems.  This application provides a
complete environment for experimenting with the architecture.
It includes an editor, assembler, linker, emulator, a
collection of examples, an integrated development environment
(IDE) with a graphical user interface, and a user guide with
tutorials.

** Running Sigma16

Sigma16 runs in a web browser: you don't need to download or
install anything.

#+INDEX: run

#+BEGIN_EXPORT html
<div style="overflow-x: auto">
#+END_EXPORT
#+BEGIN_majornote
To run Sigma16, visit the Sigma16 Home Page at
[[https://jtod.github.io/home/Sigma16]]
and click the prominent /Run/ link.
#+END_majornote
#+BEGIN_EXPORT html
</div>
#+END_EXPORT

#+INDEX: command line
There are additional command line tools that can run in a
shell; see the Installation section.  There is also a digital
circuit (available separately) that implements the
architecture, as well as a functional hardware description
language, Hydra, that simulates circuits.  Using these tools,
machine language programs can run on both the emulator and
the circuit.

This is free software, and the source code is available at
[[https://github.com/jtod/Sigma16]].
** Browser compatibility

#+BEGIN_majornote
This version of Sigma16 runs on up-to-date versions of
browsers based on Chromium, including Opera, Chrome, Edge,
DuckDuckGo.  Currently, it does not work on Safari or
Firefox.
#+END_majornote

** Organization

The architecture is organized into subsets to make it easier
to learn and to use:

- The *Core* subset has a small instruction set which is a
  good starting point for learning about computer
  architecture.  Although simple, Core is powerful enough to
  support realistic programming.

- The *Standard* subset offers flexible programming
  techniques, including manipulation of bits, Boolean
  expressions, shifting, extracting fields, arithmetic on
  natural numbers and arbitrary precision integers, and
  concise support for stack frames. It also supports the
  study of systems programming, providing interrupts,
  protection, concurrent processes, mutual exclusion, and
  memory management.
  
For a quick start, begin with the Core tutorials, which
introduce the architecture step by step.  The tutorials
explain the machine, show how to program it, and demonstrate
how to enter and run a program and how to use the programming
environment.  A reference section follows the tutorials.

The architecture focuses on fundamental concepts and
principles.  Sigma16 illustrates the basic ideas of computer
systems while avoiding unnecessary complexity. Most
commercial computers that achieve success in the marketplace
evolve through updates and extensions, and eventually become
encrusted with complications that help support backward
compatibility but that lead to complexity.


* Core architecture tutorials
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: sec-core-tutorial
:END:

The following short tutorials introduce the system; full
details appear in later sections.  You can keep the tutorials
visible in the right panel while following along with the
examples in the main panel.

** Hello, world!

Let's begin by running a simple example program.  For now, we
focus only on how to use the software tools.  You don't need
to understand the example code yet.  An explanation of the
program and the Sigma16 architecture will come later.

To launch the app, visit the Sigma16 Home Page and click on
the link to run it.  Sigma16 runs in the browser; you don't
need to download or install anything.

- Click *Editor*, then *Hello, world!*.  This will enter a
  small assembly language program into the editor window.
  Later, we'll load some of the more complex example programs
  into the editor, and you can also modify a program or type
  in a new one from scratch.  For now, don't worry about the
  content of the program.

- Click *Assembler*.  The assembler translates programs in
  assembly language (the source program) to machine language
  (the object program).  Assembly language is a
  human-readable notation, while machine language is what the
  computer can execute.  When you first enter the Assembler
  tab, the assembly language text in the Editor window is
  copied over; this is the source program.

- Click the *Assemble* button.  This will do the translation.
  The *assembly listing* is displayed: this shows the
  original source code along with the machine language, and
  any error messages.  The *Show object* button displays the
  object code, which is the machine language program produced
  by the translation.  The *Show source* button displays the
  original source code, and the *Show Listing* button
  displays the assembly listing again.

- For this simple example, we don't need the Linker, so you
  can skip it.  The linker is needed for larger and more
  complex programs with multiple modules, or with external
  references, or that need relocation.
  
- Click *Processor*, which shows the main components of the
  computer architecture, including registers and memory.
  These components are explained later.  For now, just note
  that this page is where you can run programs using the
  emulator.

- Still on the Processor page, click *Boot*.  This reads the
  machine language program into the memory, and you can see
  it in the Memory display.  The source code (the assembly
  language) appears in the bottom section.  If the assembler
  produced any error messages, the program will not boot
  until you fix the errors.

- Click *Step*.  The processor executes a single instruction
  and displays the effects on the registers and memory: blue
  for /using/ a value, and red for /modifying/ it.  The
  assembly listing shows the instruction that just executed
  by highlighting it in red.  It also shows the instruction
  that will execute next by highlighting it in blue.  This is
  just to make it easier to follow what is happening; the
  machine executes the machine language program, which is in
  memory, and it ignores the assembly language listing which
  is just a convenience to help you follow the program.  The
  machine relies only on the registers and memory, and
  doesn't even "know" that the assembly listing exists.

  There is a keyboard shortcut: after you have clicked Step
  once, you can press the space bar to execute the next
  instruction.  Thus you can step through the program by
  clicking Step, and then pressing the space bar repeatedly.

- Click Step repeatedly to watch the program execute,
  instruction by instruction.  When the program terminates,
  the small window labelled *Emulator* will display *Halted*.

- You can also run the program to completion, without having
  to click Step so many times.  Click *Boot* again to get the
  machine back into the initial state.  Now click *Run*, and
  the program will continue executing instructions until it
  halts.

To run the program slowly, click Step repeatedly.  To run the
program faster but without updating the display after each
instruction, click Run.  At any time you can click Pause to
stop the processor, and you can resume execution with either
Step or Run.  Sometimes it's useful to let the processor run
at full speed until it reaches a particular instruction, and
then stop.  This can be done by setting a *breakpoint*
(described in the Breakpoint tutorial below).

To exit the app, just close the browser window or tab.  This
may put up a dialogue box warning that any unsaved data may
be lost and asking you to confirm.

** A quick tour

This tutorial introduces the main components of the
architecture as well as the graphical user interface.

The main window contains two main sections.  The largest
area, on the left side, is the *main working area*.  When the
program launches, this will show the Welcome page.  The *user
guide* is on the right side.  At the top is a row of buttons
(Welcome, Examples, etc.).  These select which page is
displayed in the main working area.

It's convenient to see the main working area and the user
guide side by side.  Begin by resizing the entire window
(bigger is better).  Then you can change the amount of space
given to the user guide by clicking the arrow symbols on the
right side of the top button bar.  These arrows will expand
or shrink the user guide: the small arrows adjust by one
pixel, the larger arrows by ten pixels.  If you resize the
entire browser window, Sigma16 will maintain the same
relative sizes of the main working area and the user guide
sections.

If your screen is small, and the main working area isn't big
enough, click /Hide User Guide/ and all the space will be
made available to it.  The button will change to /Show User
Guide/.

You can also open the User Guide in a separate browser tab or
window.  The Welcome page contains a link to do this.

The main working area has several pages, with tab buttons at
the top to switch between them:

- *Welcome* contains some introductory information and links.
   
- *Examples* contains a collection of assembly language
  programs organized by the architecture subset.  Start with
  the Core examples.

- *Modules* shows a summary of all the files and modules you
  currently have open.  It also provides buttons allowing you
  to open files on your computer, close them, and select one
  to work on.

- *Editor* shows the selected module, where it can be edited.
  You can assemble and execute the selected module.  To run a
  program, you'll load it into the Editor (there are several
  ways to do this), then assemble it (Assembler tab) and then
  run it (Processor tab).

- *Assembler* translates a program from assembly language to
  machine language, and shows the assembly listing as well as
  the object code.

- *Linker* is used to combine a collection of object code modules
  into a single executable program.  It also performs external
  name resolution and relocation.  Programs that consist of just
  one module do not need the linker, and you can skip it.

- *Processor* shows the components of the architecture and
  executes machine language programs.

- *Options* allows you to configure how the system operates.

- *About* gives general information about the software, including
  the version.

- *Hide User Guide* makes the entire window available to the main
  working area.  It is a toggle that changes to *Show User Guide*.
  
** Registers, constants, and arithmetic

#+INDEX: register file
Programs do most of their work using the *register file*, which is
an array of 16 registers named R0, R1, R2, ..., R15.  The Register
File is displayed in a box on the Processor page.

A register is a circuit that can hold a number, and the elements
of the register file can be used to hold variable values.  They
are analogous to the registers in a calculator: think of each
register as a box that can hold a number, and think of the
register name as a variable name.  Two of the registers, R0 and
R15, are special and should not be used to hold variables.

A computer program is a sequence of *instructions*.  Instructions
are similar to statements in a programming language, but they are
simpler.

Sigma16 performs arithmetic on data in registers.  To do any
computation on some numbers, we first need to get those numbers
into registers.  The *lea* instruction. can be used to place a
constant into a register.  For example, to load 42 into register
3, write

#+BEGIN_SRC Sigma16 exports: code
     lea  R3,42[R0]     ; R3 := 42
#+END_SRC

This is a statement in *assembly language*, and it describes one
instruction.  This statement contains three parts:

- The *operation* is *lea*.  This tells the computer what action
  to perform, and "lea" says to put a value into a register.
  Later we will see why this instruction is called "lea".
- The *operands* are *R2,42[R0]*.  R2 is the /destination/, where
  the value will be placed.  The value to be put into the
  destination is 42.  For now, ignore the *[R0]*; its purpose will
  be described later.

- Everything after the semicolon is a *comment*.  This comment is
  a programming language statement that describes what the
  instruction does: it sets the variable R3 to 42.

The name *lea* is the *operation*, i.e. the name of the
instruction.  The operand field consists of two operands separated
by a comma.  The first operand, R2, is called the *destination*;
this is the register where the result will be placed.  The second
operand is a constant 42 followed by [R0].  When the computer
executes this instruction, it simply places the constant into the
destination.  In a higher level language, we could write *R2 :=
42*.

Most instructions follow a similar pattern: the first operand is
the destination where the result is placed, and the subsequent
operands are the arguments to the computation.  This is the same
convention used in assignment statements in many programming
languages: the registers in add R1,R2,R3 appear in the same order
as the variables in R1 := R2 + R3.

All arithmetic operations take place in the registers, and there
is a separate instruction for each operation.  For example, the
following instruction will add the values in R8 and R1 and then
put the result into R4:

#+BEGIN_SRC Sigma16 exports: code
    add   R4,R8,R1  ; R4 := R8 + R1
#+END_SRC

Notice that the operand field doesn't use operators like := or +;
those are specified by the operation field (lea, add).  Each
instruction performs only one operation.  The operand field just
separates the operands with commas.  The first operand (R4 in this
example) is the *destination*, which is where the result will be
placed.  The last two operands (R8 and R1) are the values that
will be added.

To perform a calculation, we need to get the data into registers
(using lea) and then perform the calculation (using arithmetic
instructions).  The following program calculates 3 + 4 and puts
the result into R2:

#+BEGIN_SRC Sigma16 exports: code
     lea   R5,3[R0]    ; R5 := 3
     lea   R8,4[R0]    ; R8 := 4
     add   R2,R5,R8    ; R2 := R5 + R8 = 3+4 = 7
#+END_SRC

It's a good idea to use comments to explain the meaning of an
instruction.  For now, comments like "R4 := R8 + R1" will be used
to show what the instruction does. That's useful while learning
what the instructions do, but later on we will use comments to
give more meaningful information (for example, what do the values
in the registers mean, and why are we adding them?).

There are three more arithmetic instructions.  These follow the
same pattern as add: in each case, the arithmetic is performed on
the last two registers and the result is placed in the destination
(the first register):

#+BEGIN_SRC Sigma16 exports: code
     add  R4,R11,R6   ; R4 := R11 + R6
     sub  R5,R2,R13   ; R5 := R2 - R13
     mul  R2,R10,R7   ; R2 := R10 * R7
     div  R5,R6,R12   ; R5 := R6 / R12, R15 := R6 rem R12
#+END_SRC

The divide instruction is slightly different: it produces two
results, the quotient and the remainder.  The quotient is placed
in the destination, and the remainder is automatically placed into
R15, even though the instruction doesn't mention R15.  If you
write *div R15,R1,R2*, the quotient is placed in R15 and the
remainder is discarded.

Normally an arithmetic instruction will put a new value into the
destination register, but the operand registers are left
unchanged.  However, what happens if one of the operands is the
same as the destination, for example *add R7,R7,R8*?

An arithmetic instruction proceeds in three phases: (1) obtain the
values in the operand registers; (2) perform the arithmetic on
those values; and (3) put the result into the destination,
discarding whatever value was previously there.  So consider this
example:

#+BEGIN_SRC Sigma16 exports: code
    lea   R7,20[R0]  ; R7 := 20
    lea   R8,30[R0]  ; R8 := 30
    add   R7,R7,R8   ; R7 := R7 + R8
#+END_SRC

After the two lea instructions have executed, R7 contains 20 and
R8 contains 30.  The add instruction does the following:

1. It fetches the values in R7 and R8, obtaining 20 and 30
2. It adds the values, obtaining the result 50
3. It puts the result 50 into the destination R7, discarding the
   previous value.
   
The final result is that R7 contains 50.

Constant data can be specified using either decimal or hexadecimal
notation.

- Decimal numbers are written as strings of digits, optionally
  preceded by a minus sign: 3,-19, 42.  Leading zeros are
  optional, so 23 and 0023 both mean the same (twenty three).

- Hexadecimal numbers are written as four hex digits, and in
  assembly language programs they are indicated by putting $
  before the number.  Thus $00a5 and 0165 both represent the
  integer 165.

The processor page shows numbers as hex without the leading $, but
in an assembly language program the $ is needed to avoid
ambiguity.

Sigma uses := as the assignment operator; thus we write R7 := R7 +
R8 (and we don't write R7 = R7 + R8).  This is because an
assignment statement is profoundly different from an equation, and
mathematicians have long used the = operator to indicate
equations.  It isn't just an academic or theoretical point; there
have been plenty of occasions where computer programmers get
confused between assignment and equality, and using the wrong
operator leads to serious bugs.  (A major security breach occurred
because a C programmer forgot that in C, = does not mean equals.)

Why does assembly language use a notation like add R5,R2,R3
instead of R5 := R2 + R3?  In short, every instruction will use a
similar notation: a keyword for the operation, followed by the
operands separated by commas.  This notation is also related
closely to the way instructions are represented in memory, which
we'll see later.

An arithmetic instruction performs just one operation.  Several
instructions are needed to evaluate a larger expression.  In
general, you'll need a separate instruction for every operator
that appears in an expression.

Example: calculate 6 + 2 * 4 and put the result into R10.  We have
to put the numbers into registers, using lea, and then perform the
arithmetic.  It doesn't matter which registers are used (as long
as we avoid R0 and R15).

#+BEGIN_SRC Sigma16 exports: code
    lea   R1,6[R0]    ; R1 := 6
    lea   R2,2[R0]    ; R2 := 2
    lea   R3,4[R0]    ; R3 := 4
    mul   R2,R2,R3    ; R2 := R2*R3 = 2*8 = 8
    add   R10,R1,R2   ; R10 := R1+R2 = 6+8 = 14 (hex 000e)
    trap  R0,R0,R0    ; halt
#+END_SRC

This is nearly enough to constitute a complete program.  Only one
more thing is needed: a way to terminate the program when it
finishes.  There is a special instruction to do this: a trap
instruction, where the first operand is R0, will stop the program.

#+BEGIN_SRC Sigma16 exports: code
    trap  R0,R0,R0   ; halt
#+END_SRC

Here is a complete program named ConstArith.  It consists of
1. Comments that identify the program
2. Comments that say what it does
3. The instructions
4. A trap instruction to terminate execution

*** Running an example program
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: sec-examples
:END:

You can go to the Editor, and type it in (or copy and paste it
in), but this program is part of the collection of examples built
in to Sigma16.  Here's how to run it:

- Go to the *Examples* page.  Click *Examples*, then *Core*, then
  *Simple*.  This brings up a list of small and simple example
  programs.  Click *ConstArith.asm.txt*.  You should see the
  listing of the program.  The file name has an extension
  *.asm.txt* that identifies the file as an assembly language
  source program.

- Click *Editor*, and you should see the text of the program in
  the window.

- Go to the *Assembler* page and click *Assemble*.

- Go to the *Processor* page.  Click *Boot*, then *Step*
  repeatedly and watch the effect of each instruction by observing
  how the registers are changed.

The Processor page shows numbers in hexadecimal.  The add
instruction puts 14 into R10, and this is displayed as hex 000e.

It's a good idea to step through the program slowly, rather than
running it to completion at full speed.  The emulator will show
the next instruction to be executed, highlighted in blue.  Think
about what the instruction should do; in particular what changes
to the registers will occur?  Then click Step and check to see if
the right thing happened.

Generally you can use any register you like (apart from R0 and
R15), and the choices of registers in the previous examples are
arbitrary.  Registers R1 through R14 behave the same.  However,
two of the registers are different:

- *R0* contains the constant 0 and it will never change.  Any time
  an instruction uses R0, the value it gets will be 0.  It is
  legal for an instruction to attempt to modify R0 (for example,
  add R0,R3,R4 is legal) but after executing this instruction R0
  still contains 0.  The reason for this is that we frequently
  need to have access to a register containing 0.
  
- *R15* is used for two specific purposes.  We have already seen
  the first: the divide instruction places the remainder into R15.
  The second purpose is that R15 contains the *condition code*,
  which is a word that contains a number of bits that provide some
  information about an instruction.  For example, if an addition
  produces a result that is too large to fit in a register, a
  special flag indicating this is set in R15.  Several of the
  instructions, particularly the arithmetic instructions, change
  the value of R15 as well as placing the result in the
  destination register.  For this reason, R15 cannot be used to
  hold a variable since its value would be destroyed almost
  immediately.
  
To summarise, Registers R1 through R14 are all identical and can
be used for variables.  R0 contains 0 and will never change.  R15
changes frequently and can be used to detect various error
conditions and other information about an instruction.

Here is another example:

- Suppose we have variables a, b, c, d

- And suppose we already have these variables in registers

- Choose a register for each variable: R1=a, R2=b, R3=c, R4=d

- We wish to compute R5 = (a+b) * (c-d)

#+BEGIN_SRC Sigma16 exports: code
     add   R6,R1,R2     ; R6 := a + b
     sub   R7,R3,R4     ; R7 := c - d
     mul   R5,R6,R7     ; R5 := (a+b) * (c-d)
#+END_SRC

Summary.

- A lea instruction of the form *lea Rd,const[R0]* will put the
  constant into Rd.  It can also be written as *lea Rd,const*.

- The general form of an arithmetic instruction is *op d,a,b*.
  The meaning is *R_d := R_a op R_b*, and the fields are:
  - op is one of add, sub, mul, div
  - Rd is the destination register (where the result goes)
  - Ra is the register containing the first operand
  - Rb is the register containing the second operand

** Keeping variables in memory

So far we have used registers in the register file to hold
variables.  However, there are only 16 of these, and two have
special purposes (R0 and R15).  That leaves only 14 registers for
general use, and most programs need more than 14 variables.

To solve this problem, the computer contains another subsystem
called the *memory*.  The memory contains a sequence of *memory
locations*, each of which can hold a word (16 bits).  Each
location is identifed by an *address*, which is a natural number
$0, 1, 2, 3, \ldots, 65535$.  The notation *M[a]* denotes the
value stored in the memory location with address a.

The register file and the memory serve different purposes:

- The register file is used to perform calculations.  In computing
  something like x := (2*a + 3*b) / (x-1), all the arithmetic must
  be done using the register file.  For example, the instruction
  add R1,R5,R3 has both operands and destination in registers, and
  this is true for all arithmetic instructions.  The purpose of
  the registers is to provide fast access to a small number of
  variables while they are needed for calculations.
 
- There are only a few registers available, so we can't keep all
  the variables permanently in registers.  The memory is much
  larger: it contains 65,536 locations so it can hold all the
  variables in a program.  But the memory is slow, and it has a
  limitation: there is no instruction that can do arithmetic on
  data in the memory.  The purpose of the memory is to hold large
  amounts of data for future use.
  
Normally, a program keeps its variables in memory, so a variable
name refers to a memory location.  The variable name just stands
for the /address/ of the location that contains the variable.
This allows you to refer to a variable by a name (x, sum, count)
rather than an address (003c, 0104, 00d7).

*** load and store

Since we need a lot of variables, they need to be kept in memory.
But since we need to do arithmetic, and arithmetic can be
performed only on data in registers, we adopt the following
strategy:

- Keep variables permanently in memory.
- When you need to do arithmetic on some variables, copy them from
  memory to registers.
- When finished, copy the results from registers back to memory.

Two instructions are needed to do this:

- *load* copies a word from a memory location into a register.
  Suppose *xyz* is a variable in memory; then to copy its value
  into R2 we write *load R2,xyz[R0]*.

- *store* copies a word from a register into a memory location.
  If R3 contains the result of some calculations, and we want to
  put it back into memory in a variable named result, we would
  write *store R3,result[R0]*.
  
At this point we have enough instructions to write an assignment
statement in assembly language.  Typically we will first write an
algorithm using higher level language notation, and then translate
it into instructions.  Translating from a high level language to
assembly language is called "compiling".

Example: translate *x := a+b+c* into assembly language.

Solution:

#+BEGIN_SRC Sigma16 exports: code
    load   R1,a[R0]      ; R1 := a
    load   R2,b[R0]      ; R2 := b
    add    R3,R1,R2      ; R3 := a+b
    load   R4,c[R0]      ; R4 := c
    add    R5,R3,R4      ; R5 := (a+b) + c
    store  R5,x[R0]      ; x := a+b+c
#+END_SRC

*** The data statement

The variables used in a program need to be defined and given an
initial value.  This is done with the *data* statement.  The
variable name comes first, and it must start at the beginning of
the line (no space before it).  Then comes the keyword *data*,
followed by the initial value, which may be written in either
decimal or hexadecimal.  These pieces of the statement must be
separated by white space.

For example, to define variables x, y, z and give them initial
values:

#+BEGIN_SRC Sigma16 exports: code
x    data   34    ; x is a variable with initial value 34
y    data    9    ; y is initially 9
z    data    0    ; z is initially 0
abc  data  $02c6  ; specify initial value as hex
#+END_SRC

The data statements should come *after* all the instructions in
the program.  This may look surprising: in some programming
languages you have to declare your variables at the beginning,
before using them.  There is a good reason why we will put the
instructions first, and the data statements after; but the reason
will come later.

Here is a simple example of a complete program that uses load,
store, and data statements, to implement z := x + y.

#+BEGIN_SRC Sigma16 exports: code
; Program Add.  See README in top Sigma16 folder A minimal
; program that adds two integer variables

; Execution starts at location 0, where the first instruction
; will be placed when the program is executed.

      load   R1,x[R0]   ; R1 := x
      load   R2,y[R0]   ; R2 := y
      add    R3,R1,R2   ; R3 := x + y
      store  R3,z[R0]   ; z := x + y
      trap   R0,R0,R0   ; terminate

; Expected result: z = 37 (0025)

; Static variables are placed in memory after the program

x     data  23
y     data  14
z     data   0
#+END_SRC

Now you can run the program:

- Go to the Examples page.  Click Core, then Simple, then
  Add.
- Click Editor, and you should see the text of the program in
  the window.
- Go to the Assembler page.  Click Assemble.
- Go to the Processor page.  Click Boot, then Step repeatedly
  and watch the effect of each instruction by observing how
  the registers and memory are changed.

The processor page shows the contents of the memory.  For
each memory location, the address is shown followed by the
contents of that location.  For example, if a line in the
memory display shows 00b7 4c3f, this means that the memory
location with address 00b7 contains 4c3f.  This is written as
M[00b7] = 4c3f.

Memory addresses and contents, as well as register contents,
are shown in hexadecimal with no leading $.  Since all these
numbers are hexadecimal, putting $ in front (or 0x as in C)
just adds distraction without telling you anything useful.

The processor displays two independent views into the memory.
This is convenient because it's frequently necessary to look
at two different portions of the memory at the same time.
For example, it's helpful to look at the machine language
code in one view and the data in the other view.  With
programs that use advanced techniques (e.g. pointers and
activation records) it's essential to be able to view two
different areas of memory.  Despite the two views, there is
just one memory.

*** Relationship between arrays, registers, memory

The register file and the memory are similar in many ways,
and they are also similar to ordinary arrays in some
programming languages.  The essential difference is that
registers are fast but there are only a few of them, whereas
memory is large but slow.

|                     | array    | reg file   | memory   |
|---------------------+----------+------------+----------|
| Type of element:    | declared | word       | word     |
| Size of element:    | declared | 16 bits    | 16 bits  |
| Element notation:   | a[i]     | R3         | M[a]     |
| Element is called:  | element  | register   | location |
| Index is called:    | index    | reg number | address  |
| Range of index:     | declared | 0..15      | 0..65535 |
| Number of elements: | declared | *small*    | *large*  |
| Access time:        | slow     | *fast*     | *slow*   |

Why does the computer have both registers and memory?  After
all, this makes programming a little more complicated.  You
have to keep track of which variables are currently in
registers, and you have to use load and store instructions to
copy data between the registers and memory.  Wouldn't it be
easier just to get rid of the distinction between registers
and memory, and do all the arithmetic on memory?

Yes, this would be simpler, and there have been real
computers like that.  However, this approach makes the
computer slower.  With modern circuits, a computer without
load and store instructions (where you do arithmetic on
memory locations) would run approximately 100 times slower.
So nearly all modern computers do arithmetic in registers,
and use instructions like load and store to copy data back
and forth between registers and memory.

** Assembly language

The programs we have seen so far are written in *assembly
language*.  The machine itself executes programs in *machine
language*, which is covered later.  Assembly language is
translated to machine language by a program called an
*assembler*.

The purpose of assembly language is to give the programmer
absolute control over the machine language program without
having to remember lots of numeric addresses and codes.
Assembly language is readable for humans, while machine
language is executable by machines.  For example, it is
easier to remember the name "mul" for multiply than to
remember the machine language code (which happens to be 3).
Similarly, it's easier to remember the names of variables (x,
y, sum, total) than the numeric addresses of the memory
locations that hold these variables.

The syntax of assembly language is simple and rigid.  Every
statement must fit on one line of source code; you cannot
have a statement that spans several lines, and you cannot
have several statements on one line.

Sigma16 assembly language uses a small set of characters.
Any character not on this list will generate an error
message.  A Sigma16 program can *manipulate* any 16-bit
character, but the source assembly language code is
restricted to this source character set.  There are many
characters that look similar but are actually distinct.  For
example, the minus sign, the hyphen, the en-dash, and the
em-dash all look similar -- you have to look closely to see
the difference -- but Sigma16 assembly language uses the
minus sign, and the hyphens and dashes won't work.

These are the legal characters in an assembly language
program:

- letters
  - _abcdefghijk
  - lmnopqrstuvwxyz
  - ABCDEFGHIJKLMN
  - OPQRSTUVWXYZ
- digits: 0123456789
- separators: space tab ,;
- quotes: " '
- punctuation: ".$[]()+-*
- other: ?<=>!%^&{}#~@:|/\'

Word processors often substitute characters.  For example,
when you type a minus sign in a paragraph of English text,
word processors may replace the minus sign with a hyphen or
dash, which is correct for typeset English but incorrect for
assembly language.  The Sigma16 editor will insert the
correct characters, as will plain text editors.

Each statement has a rigid format that consists of up to four
*fields*.  The fields must be separated by one or more
spaces, and a field cannot contain a space.  Every field is
optional, but if a field is missing then the following fields
must also be missing, except for an optional comment.  The
fields are:

- label (optional) -- If present, the label must begin in the
  first character of the line.  If a line starts with a
  space, then there is no label field.  A label has the same
  syntax as names or identifiers in many languages: it may
  contain letters, digits, underscores, and must begin with a
  letter.  Both upper and lower case letters are allowed, and
  the syntax is case sensitive (Loop and LOOP and loop are
  three different labels).

- mnemonic -- This is the name of the operation: load, lea,
  add, sub, etc.  The mnemonic must be preceded by white
  space, and it must be the name of a valid instruction or
  assembler directive.
  
- operands field -- the operands required by the type of
  statement.  There are several formats possible for the
  operands field, depending on the instruction; these are
  detailed later.  For example, for the add instruction the
  operand field must consist of three registers, separated by
  commas (e.g. R1,R2,R3).  Spaces are not allowed in the
  operands field: R1,R2,R3 is fine but R1, R2, R3 is an
  error.

- comments -- anything that follows the operands field, or
  anything that appears after a semicolon, is a comment.  The
  semicolon is not required if the mnemonic and operands
  fields are present, but it is good practice to include it.

Here are some syntactically valid statements:

#+BEGIN_SRC Sigma16 exports: code
loop   load   R1,count[R0]    ; R1 := count
       add    R1,R1,R2        ; R1 := R1 + 1
#+END_SRC

Each of the following statements is wrong!

#+BEGIN_SRC Sigma16 exports: code
   add   R2, R8, R9    ; spaces in the operand field
loop1  store x[R0],R5  ; wrong order: should be R5,x[R0]
    addemup            ; invalid mnemonic
 loop2  load R1,x[R0]  ; Space before the label
#+END_SRC

If you forget some detail, look at one of the example
programs.

When the assembler is translating a program, it begins by
looking at the spaces in order to split each statement into
the four fields.  This happens before it looks at the
operation and operands.  The assembly listing uses colors to
indicate the different fields.  If you get a syntax error
message, the first thing to check is that the fields are what
you intended.  For example if you meant to say

#+BEGIN_SRC Sigma16 exports: code
     add R1,R2,R3  ; x := a + b
#+END_SRC
  
but you have a spurious space, like this

#+BEGIN_SRC Sigma16 exports: code
     add R1, R2,R3  ; x := a + b
#+END_SRC
  
the assembler will decide that the mnemonic is add, the
operands field is "R1," and all the rest - "R2,R3 ; x := a +
b" -- is a comment, and the colors of the text in the
assembly listing will show this clearly.

The rules above mean that a label must begin in the first
character of a line, and also that if any non-space character
appears at the beginning, it is taken to be a label.  The
following statement has a label "add", an operation
"R1,R2,R3" (and of course there is no such instruction), and
the operand field is ";".  Again, the syntax highlighting
will show the error clearly.

#+BEGIN_SRC Sigma16 exports: code
     add R1,R2,R3  ; x := a + b
#+END_SRC

In assembly language, you can write constants in either
decimal or hexadecimal.
  
- decimal:   50 -39
- hexadecimal: $003b

Examples:

#+BEGIN_SRC Sigma16 exports: code
    lea   R1,40[R0]      ; R1 = 40
    lea   R2,$ffff[R0]   ; R2 = -1

x   data  25
y   data  $2c9e
#+END_SRC

There are two instruction formats in the Core architecture,
which differ in the form of the operands:

- *RRR* instructions have an operand field containing three
  registers separated by commas.  Example: *add R8,R13,R6*.
  
- *RX* instructions have an operand field that specifies a
  register and an address.  The address is a name or
  constant, followed by a register. Examples: *load
  R12,array[R6]* and *lea R5,23[R0]*.

It isn't enough just to get the assembler to accept your
program without error messages.  Your program should be clear
and easy to read.  This requires good style.  Good style
saves time writing the program and getting it to work, while
aA sloppy program looks unprofessional and makes testing and
debugging harder.  Here are a few tips.

*Write good comments.* You should include good comments in
all programs, regardless of language.  Comments are
especially important in assembly language, because the code
tends to need more explanation.  At the beginning of the
program, use comments to identify the program and author and
to say what it does.  Use full line comments to describe in
general what's going on, and put a comment on every
instruction to explain what it's doing.

*Indent your code consistently.* Each field should be lined
up vertically, like this:

#+BEGIN_SRC Sigma16 exports: code
     load   R1,three[R0]  ; R1 = 3
     load   R2,x[R0]      ; R2 = x
     mul    R3,R1,R2      ; R3 = 3*x
     store  R3,y[R0]      ; y = 3*x
     trap   R0,R0,R0      ; stop the program
#+END_SRC

Not haphazard like this:

#+BEGIN_SRC Sigma16 exports: code
    load   R1,three[R0]     ; R1 = 3
  load  R2,x[R0] ; R2 = x
       mul R3,R1,R2           ; R3 = 3*x
 store         R3,y[R0]      ; y = 3*x
   trap  R0,R0,R0      ; stop the program
#+END_SRC

The exact number of spaces each field is indented isn't
important; what's important is to make the program neat and
readable.

*Spaces, not tabs.* To indent your code, always use spaces --
avoid tabs.  In general, never use tabs except in the (rare)
cases they are required (for example in makefiles).  The tab
character was introduced long ago into computer character
sets to try to mimic the tab key on old mechanical
typewriters.  Unfortunately, software does not handle tab
characters consistently.  If you use tabs, your program can
look good in one application and like a mess in another.
It's easy to indent with spaces, and it works everywhere.

Some programming languages use indentation to indicate
program structure.  If some of that indentation is done with
tabs, it could work on one computer but give syntax errors on
another system.  Even worse, it could compile but give
different results as the program structure has changed.
(Wrong results are worse than error messages.)

** The Editor

To run an assembly language program, you first need to put it
into the editor window.  Then you can go to the Assembler
page, assemble it and run it on the Processor page.  There
are several ways to enter a program into the editor window.

- *Starter program.* Editor tab. Click Hello World.  This
  will load a small fixed example program into the editor
  buffer.
- *Collection of examples.* Examples tab.  The Sigma15 app
  provides a collection of example programs.  Click Core to
  see the examples that use only the core instruction set.
  Click Simple, then ConstArith.  Go to the Editor tab and
  the example you selected will be in the window.  All of
  these example programs are in the Sigma16 system, not on
  your local computer.
- *Type it in.* Editor tab. Type in a program.  If there was
  already some text there, click New.
- *Read from a file.* Editor tab. Click Open File.  This
  brings up a file chooser dialog where you can traverse the
  file system on your computer and select a file.
- *Copy from file and paste.* If your program is visible in
  another window on your computer, you can copy its text,
  then go to the Sigma16 editor, and paste.  Normally it's
  better to use Open File, but if your browser has disabled
  file access the copy-paste method is ok.

You can edit the text in the Editor window:
  - Click the arrow keys or the left mouse button to move the
    cursor.
  - Click left mouse button and drag to select text.
  - Click right mouse button and select Cut, Copy, Paste,
    Undo.

*Save your work.* After typing in a program, or editing it,
you should save it to a file.  Click Save As.  This brings up
a dialog where you can traverse your file system and provide
a file name (which should end in .asm.txt).

If you leave the browser without saving the text in the
editor window to a file, that text will be lost, so it's
important to save your work regularly.  If you don't do that,
sooner or later the system will crash and you'll lose your
data.  When you close a browser tab that's running Sigma16,
the browser may put up a message warning you that "Changes
you made may not be saved".  The browser can't tell whether
the editor text needs to be saved.

The Sigma16 app will know what file is associated with your
program if you have read it from a file (Editor: Open File)
or if you have saved it to a specific location in your
computer (Editor: Save As).

Once the app knows which file contains your program, you can
edit it and save it again just by clicking Editor: Save.
This is easier than Save As because you don't need to
traverse the file system again.

You can also edit your assembly language program using an
external text editor, rather than the simple editor in the
Sigma16 app.  If you have modified the file using an external
editor, click Editor: Refresh to reload the file from your
disk.

If you do use an external text editor, use a real text editor
(emacs, vim, notepad++, or whatever you prefer), not a word
processor.  Word processors embed extra formatting data into
the file, and the assembler can't handle that.  Furthermore,
word processors often change the characters you type.  For
example, they may change the minus character (-) into an
en-dash.  There are four different characters that look
similar to a minus sign (minus, hyphen, en-dash, em-dash) and
the assembly language only accepts the minus sign.  If you
get bad characters, the assembler will give an error message.

** Jumps and conditionals

Conditionals allow a program to decide which statements to
execute based on Boolean expressions.  One example is the
if-then statement, for example:

#+BEGIN_SRC Sigma16 exports: code
if x<y
  then statement 1
statement 2
#+END_SRC

A related form is the if-then-else statement:

#+BEGIN_SRC Sigma16 exports: code
if x<y
  then statement 1
  else statement 2
statement 3
#+END_SRC

Most high level control constructs can be translated into
code that contains just one form of conditional, the
*conditional goto*.  This uses a Boolean expression /bexp/ to
decide whether to jump to /someLabel/, or not to jump:

#+BEGIN_SRC Sigma16 exports: code
if bexp then goto someLabel
#+END_SRC

The commonest case is where /bexp/ is a comparision between
two integers:

#+BEGIN_SRC Sigma16 exports: code
if x < y then goto someLabel
#+END_SRC

This statement is implemented in assembly language in two
steps:

1. First, a *comparison* instruction is used to produce a
   Boolean result, which is placed in the /condition code/
   (which is in R15).

2. Second, a *conditional jump* instruction will either jump
   or not jump, depending on the condition code.  This allows
   a choice of what instruction to execute next.

The cmp instruction compares the integers in two registers,
and it sets R15 to the result of the comparison.  R15 is a
special register because several instructions, including cmp,
use it automatically without specifying R15 in the
instruction.  Reflecting its special status, R15 also has a
name: it's called the /condition code/.

Any relational operation can be used; it isn't limited to
less-than.  You can think of the condition code as holding a
result like "less than", or "equal", etc.  The way these
comparison results are represented will be covered later.

After setting the condition code with cmp, the program
executes a conditional jump.  The instruction jumplt
someLabel[R0] will go to the instruction with the specified
label if and only if the condition code indicates "less than"
(lt).

Here is a high level language statement:

#+BEGIN_SRC Sigma16 exports: code
if x < y then goto someLabel
#+END_SRC

To implement this in assembly language, we use a cmp
instruction followed by jumplt:

#+BEGIN_SRC Sigma16 exports: code
    load   R2,x[R0]       ; R2 := x
    load   R3,y[R0]       ; R3 := y
    cmp    R2,R3          ; compare x and y
    jumplt someLabel[R0]  ; if x < y then goto someLabel
    xxx                   ; this executes if x >= y
    xxx
    xxx
someLabel
    xxx                  ; this executes if x < y
#+END_SRC

The conditional jump instructions have the form jumpXX, where
XX is a relation, such as lt, eq, and so on:

#+BEGIN_SRC Sigma16 exports: code
jumplt  someLabel[R0]  ; if <  then goto someLabel
jumple  someLabel[R0]  ; if <= then goto someLabel
jumpeq  someLabel[R0]  ; if =  then goto someLabel
jumpne  someLabel[R0]  ; if != then goto someLabel
jumpge  someLabel[R0]  ; if >= then goto someLabel
jumpgt  someLabel[R0]  ; if >  then goto someLabel
#+END_SRC

These conditional jumps treat the contents of the registers
as integers represented in two's complement notation.  This
means, for example, that $ffff is less than 0, because $ffff
represents -1.  There are several more conditional jumps that
you can use for comparing natural numbers (binary), and a few
other things as well.

A compare instruction is often followed immediately by a
conditional jump, as in the example above.  You can also save
the result of a comparison in a Boolean variable and perform
logic on Boolean variables.  The Boolean variables can later
be used to control conditional jumps.  This topic will be
discussed later, as it involves instructions from the full
standard instruction set.

The address in a jump instruction -- the place to jump to --
is normally specified as a label which is defined in the
label field of some instruction.  You can place a label in
the same line as the instruction, or it can be on a line with
nothing else, in which case the label refers to the next
instruction.  In the following code, label1 is the address of
the add instruction and label 2 is the address of the sub
instruction.

#+BEGIN_SRC Sigma16 exports: code
label1   add  R2,R4,R13
label2
         sub  R15,R0,R1
#+END_SRC

If-then constructs are translated into assembly language
following two similar fixed patterns.  Suppose Bexp is a
Boolean in any register Rd

#+BEGIN_SRC Sigma16 exports: code
if bexp
  then statement 1
statement 2
#+END_SRC

This is translated according to the following pattern:

#+BEGIN_SRC Sigma16 exports: code
     if !bexp then goto L2
     statement 1
L2:
     statement 2
#+END_SRC

Here is an example:

#+BEGIN_SRC Sigma16 exports: code
a := 93
x := 35
y := 71
if y > x then a := 59
b := 104
#+END_SRC

The corresponding assembly language is:

#+BEGIN_SRC Sigma16 exports: code
; a := 93
      lea     R1,93[R0]    ; R1 := 93
      store   R1,a[R0]     ; a := 93

; x := 35
      lea     R1,35[R0]    ; R1 := 35
      store   R1,x[R0]     ; x := 35

; y := 71
      lea     R1,71[R0]    ; R1 := 71
      store   R1,x[R0]     ; x := 71

; if y > x
      load    R1,y[R0]     ; R1 := y
      load    R2,x[R0]     ; R2 := x
      cmp     R1,R2        ; compare y with x
      jumple  R3,skip[R0]  ; if not y > x then goto skip

;  then a := 59
      lea    R1,59[R0]     ; R1 := 59
      store  R1,a[R0]      ; a := 59

; b := 104
skip  lea    R1,104[R0]    ; R1 := 104
      store  R1,b[R0]      ; b := 104
#+END_SRC

Notice the use of jumple: if the Boolean expression (y>x) is
False we want to skip over the "then" part, so we want to
jump if y <= x (hence jumple).

An if-then-else statement has a similar compilation pattern,
but this time there are two separate parts: the "then-part"
and the "else-part".  Depending on the value of the Boolean
expression, one of those parts should be executed and the
other should be skipped over.

For if-then-else, and many other control constructs, we need
an *unconditional jump* which will always go to the specified
address, and which doesn't use a Boolean.

#+BEGIN_SRC Sigma16 exports: code
   jump   somewhere[R0]    ; go to somewhere
#+END_SRC

The general form of an if-then-else is

#+BEGIN_SRC Sigma16 exports: code
if x < y
  then S1
  else S2
S3  
#+END_SRC

The general if-then-else construct can be translated to use
just goto and conditional goto:

#+BEGIN_SRC Sigma16 exports: code
    if x >= y then goto L2
    S1
    goto L3
L2: S2
L3: S3
#+END_SRC

** Loops

Loops are implemented using compilation patterns based on
comparisons and jumps.  The fundamental form is the *while
loop*.

#+BEGIN_SRC Sigma16 exports: code
while Bexp do S1
S2
#+END_SRC

The compilation pattern is:

#+BEGIN_SRC Sigma16 exports: code
L1   if not Bexp then goto L2
     S2
     goto L1
L2
#+END_SRC

Occasionally you may encounter an infinite loop, which is
sometimes expressed as a while loop:

#+BEGIN_SRC Sigma16 exports: code
while true do S1
#+END_SRC

This doesn't need a Boolean expression; it is simply compiled
into:

#+BEGIN_SRC Sigma16 exports: code
loop
   instructions for S1
   jump   loop[R0] 
#+END_SRC

Infinite loops are rather rare, or at least they should be.
On occasion they are exactly what is wanted.  For example,
operating systems contain a loop that looks for something
useful to do, and then does it, and this should be an
infinite loop.

However, there is a common but poor programming style that
uses infinite loops with random break or goto statements to
get out of the loop.  This may be appropriate on occasion but
generally it is bad style.

So far we have seen several compilation patterns:

- if-then
- if-then-else
- while

Every high level programming construct has a compilation
pattern, and they are mostly built using comparisons and
jumps.  In principle, these patterns are straightforward to
use.  However, there are two issues that require a little
care: uniqueness of labels and nested statements.

Labels must be unique: the same one cannot be used twice in
the same program, and if it is, the assembler will give an
error message.  This means that you cannot follow the
compilation patterns blindly.  If you use "loop" as the label
for a while loop, as in the pattern above, you need a
different label for your next while loop.

The best approach here is not to use labels like loop, loop1,
loop2.  It's far better to think about the *purpose* of the
construct in your program and to use a label that reflects
this purpose.

Another complication is that most programs contain *nested
statements*.  These are statements that contain smaller
statements, and the containment may go several levels deep.

#+BEGIN_SRC Sigma16 exports: code
if b1
  then S1
       if b2 then S2 else S3
       S4
  else S5;
       while b3 do S6
S7
#+END_SRC

There is an important principle to follow here: every time a
statement appears in a compilation pattern (we have been
calling them S1, S2, S3, etc.), it should be translated as a
*block*.

A block is a sequence of instructions which *always* begins
execution at the first instruction, and *always* finishes at
the end.  You *never* jump into the middle of it, and it
*never* jumps out of the middle to some other place.
  
Every statement should be compiled into a block of code.
This block may contain internal structure --- it may contain
several smaller blocks --- but to execute it you should
always begin at the beginning and it should always finish at
the end.

In programming language theory, programming with blocks is
often considered to be good practice or good style.  But it
is more than just an issue of style.  If you always treat the
statements inside compilation patterns as blocks, the
patterns will "just work", no matter how deeply nested they
are.  If you violate the block structure, you will find it
difficult to get the program to work.

** Machine language

The bits representing an instruction (written in hex) (e.g
0d69) are *machine language*.  The hardware runs the machine
language --- it's just looking at the numbers.  The text
notation with names -- e.g. add R13,R6,R9 -- is called
*assembly language*.  Assembly language is for humans to read
and write; machine language is for machines to execute.  Both
languages specify the program in complete detail, down to the
last bit.

As a program is running, the memory contains all your
program's data: the variables, data structures, arrays,
lists, etc.  *The memory also contains the machine language
program itself.* The program is stored inside the computer's
main memory, along with the data.  This concept is called
*the stored program computer*.
  
There is an alternative approach: a computer can be designed
to have one memory to hold the data, and a completely
separate memory to hold the program.  This approach is often
used for special-purpose computers (primarily
micro-controllers), but experience has shown this to be
inferior for general purpose computers.

Sigma16 has several different kinds of instruction.  These
are called /instruction formats/.  All the instructions with
the same format have similar representations in machine
language.  The Sigma16 Core has two instruction formats:
  
-  RRR instructions use the registers
-  RX instructions use the memory
 
The machine language program is in the memory.  Therefore we
need to represent each instruction as a word that can be
stored in memory.  An instruction format is a systematic way
to represent an instruction using one or more words (a word
is a string of bits).
  
- An RRR instruction is represented in one word
- An RX instruction is represented in two words.

*** RRR instructions

Every RRR instruction is represented in one word (16 bits),
which is organised as four 4-bit fields.  When describing a
machine word, we normally write each field value as a
hexadecimal digit: one of 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, a, b,
c, d, e, f.  These correspond to 0, 1, ..., 15 in decimal.

The machine language code needs to specify which RRR
instruction this is.  Is it add? sub?  mul? another?  This is
done with an operation code --- a number that says what the
operation is.  There are about a dozen RRR instructions, so a
4-bit operation code suffices.  For example, the add
instruction has an opcode of 0.

We also need to specify three registers: destination and two
source operands.  There are 16 registers, so a specific one
can be specified by 4 bits.  Thus the requirements for an RRR
instruction are 4 fields, each containing 4 bits, for a total
of 16 bits, so an RRR instruction exactly fills one word.

The four fields in an RRR instruction are named:
- op -- Operation code (e.g. add, sub, etc.)  This is a
  number that specifies which instruction it is.
- d -- Destination register
- a -- First source operand register
- b -- Second source operand register
  
Here are the operation codes for the RRR instructions we have
seen so far.  There are a few more RRR instructions, but they
all have the same form as these do.

| mnemonic | opcode |
|----------+--------|
| add      |      0 |
| sub      |      1 |
| mul      |      2 |
| div      |      3 |
| trap     |      c |

Don't memorise this table: you just need to understand how
it's used.  For example, let's translate this assembly
language statement into machine language:

#+BEGIN_SRC Sigma16 exports: code
    mul  R14,R6,R10
#+END_SRC

1. mul is an RRR instruction, so we need to find the values
   of the four fields: op, d, a, b.
2. The table above says that the opcode for mul is $2 (that's
   0010 as a bit string).
3. The destination is R14, so the d field is $e.
4. The first operand is R6, so the a field is $6.
5. The last operand is R10, so the b field is $a.
6. Putting the fields together ("assembling them into an
   instruction"), we get the machine language instruction:
   $2e6a.
   
Every RRR instruction is assembled the same way.  The numbers
in the fields will be different, but the procedure is always
exactly the same.

*** RX instructions
  
We have seen several RX instructions so far:
  
#+BEGIN_SRC Sigma16 exports: code
    lea    R5,19[R0]   ; R5 = 19
    load   R1,x[R0]    ; R1 = x
    store  R3,z[R0]    ; z = R3
#+END_SRC

An RX instruction contains two operands, separated by a
comma.
- The first operand is a register, and it's called the
  "register operand" (e.g. R5)
- The second operand is a constant or label followed by a
  register (e.g. 19[R0] or x[R0]).  This is called the
  "address operand", and it contains two parts:
  - The first part is either a constant like 19, or a label
    like x.  This part is called the "displacement", and its
    value is one word.  If this part is a constant (e.g. 19)
    then the value of the displacement is simply the value of
    the constant.  If it's a label like x, the value is the
    address in memory of x.
  - The seocnd part is a register in square brackets,
    e.g. [R0].  This is called the "index register".  In the
    examples we've seen so far, the index register has always
    been R0, but in general it can be any register, and this
    is useful for several purposes we'll see later.

For RRR instructions, the op field contains a number saying
which RRR instruction it is.  This is the primary opcode.
For RX instructions, the op field always contains f.  So how
does the machine know which RX instruction it is?  This is
specified by a secondary code in the b field.  Here are the
full codes (op and b) for a few of the RX instructions:

| mnemonic | op | b  |
|----------+----+----|
| lea      | $f | $0 |
| load     | $f | $1 |
| store    | $f | $2 |

Consider this assembly language statement:

#+BEGIN_SRC Sigma16 exports: code
     lea   R2,38[R7]
#+END_SRC

There are two words in the machine language code.  The first
word has the same 4 fields as for RRR instructions: op, d, a,
b, where
  
- op contains $f for every RX instruction
- d contains the register operand (in the example, $2)
- a contains the index register (in the example, $7)
- b contains a code indicating which RX instruction this is
  (1 means load).  This "secondary opcode" is required
  because the op field just indicates that the instruction is
  RX format, but doesn't say which RX instruction it is.
  
The second word contains the *displacement*.  In the example,
this is 38 (or $0026).

If the address field of an instruction has a label (like x)
rather than a constant (lik 204), we need to know the value
of the label in order to assemble the instruction.  If x is a
variable, the value of the label x is the address of the
variable in memory.  If x is a label on an instruction, its
value is the address of the instruction.

Example: translate load R7,x[R12] from assembly language to
machine language, given that the address of x is $0c3a.
- First word:
  - op = $f (indicates that this is an RX instruction, but
    not which one; that needs the b field)
  - d = $7 (the register operand)
  - a = $c (part of the address operand: the register [R12])
  - b = $1 (this is the secondary opcode, which indicates
    that this RX instruction is load)
  - The first word is $f701
- Second word:
  - The displacement, part of the address operand, is $0c3a
- The complete machine language instruction: $f7c1 $0c3a

The instruction jump loop[R0] has only one operand in
assembly language, which is loop[R0].  This looks like an
exception: the other RX instructions have two operands.
However, the machine language representation of jump also
contains a register operand, just like all RX instructions,
but the machine ignores that register when the program runs,
and the assembler just sets it to R0 in the machine code.
This is called a "don't care" operand.

*** Pseudoinstructions

We have seen conditional jump instructions like *jumplt
loop*.  Technically, jumplt, jumpeq and the rest are called
"pseudoinstructions".  They are just a convenient assembly
language notations to describe the actual underlying machine
language instructions.  All conditional jumps are expressed
in machine language using just two real instructions: jumpc0
and jumpc1:

#+BEGIN_SRC Sigma16 exports: code
    jumpc0 Rd,disp[Ra]
    jumpc1 Rd,disp[Ra]
#+END_SRC

The details of how jumpc0 and jumpc1 work will be discussed
in the section on the Standard architecture.  Here is a list
of the pseudoinstructions for conditional jumps after an
integer comparison:

#+BEGIN_SRC Sigma16 exports: code
    jumplt  someLabel[R0]  ; if <  then goto someLabel
    jumple  someLabel[R0]  ; if <= then goto someLabel
    jumpeq  someLabel[R0]  ; if =  then goto someLabel
    jumpne  someLabel[R0]  ; if != then goto someLabel
    jumpge  someLabel[R0]  ; if >= then goto someLabel
    jumpgt  someLabel[R0]  ; if >  then goto someLabel
#+END_SRC

** A strange program

Consider "Program Strange" below.  You can find the program
on the Examples page (go to the Core/Instructions section),
or you can copy it from below and paste it into the Editor
page.

This program doesn't compute anything particularly useful.
It's rather strange and not a model for good programming
style, but it illustrates an extremely important concept,
which is discussed in the solution below.

The program has a variable y which is defined in the last
line: y data 0.  But you can edit that line to give y any
initial value; it doesn't need to be 0.

The aim of this tutorial is to figure out what the program
does, and to do so for several specific values of y.  A
solution is given below, but please try first to work it out
for yourself.

*** The problem

Run the program with several different initial values of the
variable y.  These values are given below.  For each run,
assume that all the registers contain 0 after the program is
booted, before it begins execution.  For each value of y, do
the following:
1. Edit the last statement of the program to give y the
   specified value.
2. Execute the program manually, with paper and pencil but
   without the computer.  Give the final values of the
   registers.  Think about what is going on as the program
   runs.
3. Assemble the program and boot it in the processor.  Run
   the program on the emulator and check whether your
   execution was correct.  Be sure to single-step through the
   program.  Before executing an instruction, think about
   what it will do.  Then click Step and look at the
   registers to see if you were right.

Here are the different variations:
1. Run the program in its original form, with *y data 0*
2. Change the last line to *y data 1* and run it again
3. Now use *y data 256*
4. *y data 8192*
5. *y data -5424*

And here is the program:

#+BEGIN_SRC Sigma16 exports: code
; Strange: A Sigma16 program that is a bit strange    
        load   R1,y[R0]
        load   R2,x[R0]
        add    R2,R2,R1
        store  R2,x[R0]
        lea    R3,3[R0]
        lea    R4,4[R0]
x       add    R5,R3,R3
        add    R0,R0,R7
        trap   R0,R0,R0
y       data   0
#+END_SRC

*** Solution

It's best to try answering the questions on your own first,
and then to check by running the program on the emulator,
before reading the solution!

The program loads an *instruction* into a register, does
arithmetic on it by adding *y* to it, and stores the result
back into memory.  This phenomenon is called *self-modifying
code*, and it exploits the fact that instructions and data
are held in the same memory (this is the *stored program
computer* concept).  The original instruction is *add
R5,R3,R3*, and its machine language code is 0533.

1. When y=0, the final values are: R1=0, R2=0533, R3=3, R4=4,
   R5=6.  The only notable points are that the store
   instruction doesn't actually change the value of the word
   in memory (it was 0533 and 0533 is being stored there),
   and the last add instruction doesn't change the value in
   R0 because R0 can never change; it is always 0.  (Of
   course if R7=0 then the result of the addition is 0
   anyway.)
  
2. When y=1, the final values are: R1=1, R2=0534, R3=3, R4=4,
   R5=7.  Note that R5 is *not* 3+3=6.  When y=1 is added to
   the instruction, the result is 0534 which means *add
   R5,R3,R4*, so instead of adding R3+R3 it adds R3+R4.

3. When y=256, the final values are: R1=256=0100, R2=0633,
   R3=3, R4=4, R5=0, R6=6. The decimal number 256 is 0100 in
   hexadecimal.  When this is added to the instruction, the
   result is 0633, which means *add R6,R3,R3* so R3+R3 is
   loaded into R6, not into R5.
   
4. When y=8192, the final values are: R1=4096=2000, R2=2533,
   R3=3, R4=4, R5=9.  The decimal number 8192 is 2000 in
   hexadecimal, and when this is added to the instruction the
   result is 2533, which means *mul R5,R3,R3*.  It's no
   longer an *add* instruction, it's a *multiply* instruction
   that calculates R5 := R3*R3 = 9.
   
5. When y=-5424 the program goes into an infinite
   loop. R1=ead0 (the hexadecimal representation of -5424),
   R2=f003, R3=3, and R4=4.  What started out as the *add*
   instruction at x has been transformed into *jump 7[R0]*,
   comprising the word at *x* (f003) and the following word
   (which is 0007).  This jump instruction goes back to the
   first lea instruction, and the program runs for ever (lea,
   lea, jump).
   
There is a lot to say about the phenomenon of self-modifying
code.

This program shows clearly that a computer does not execute
assembly language; it executes machine language.  Try running
it on the Sigma16 application (single step each instruction).
You'll see that the assembly language statement *add
R5,R3,R3* is highlighted in red, but that is just the GUI
trying to be helpful.  What's important is that the machine
language instruction is fetched from memory and loaded into
ir (the instruction register), and that is not 0533.  The
machine decodes the contents of ir and does whatever that
says to do; it isn't aware of the assembly language
statement.  Indeed, a machine doesn't even understand the
concept of assembly language --- everything is just bits!
   
To follow exactly what is happening in the emulator, it's
important to look at the pc and ir registers.  These reflect
what the machine is doing.  The assembly language does not.

What is self-modifying code good for?  The answer lies in the
early history of electronic computers.  Early computers (late
1940s and early 1950s) did not use an effective address (i.e.
displacement + index) like Sigma16; the instructions simply
specified the absolute memory address of an operand.  This is
ok for simple variables, but how could they process arrays?

The solution was to use self modifying code.  In a loop that
traverses an array, there would be a load instruction using
address 0.  In the body of the loop, there would be
instructions to calculate the address of x[i] by loading the
address of x and adding i; this is then stored into the
address field of the load instruction.  That instruction is
then executed, obtaining the value of x[i].  This technique
became obsolete in the early 1950s with the invention of
index registers and effective addresses.
   
The pioneers of computers considered the concept of the
*stored program computer* (i.e. the program and data are in
the same memory) to be fundamental and essential.  One of the
most important reasons was that it made arrays possible.  Now
we consider the stored program concept to be fundamental *for
different reasons*.
   
Self modifying code is tricky, and difficult to debug.  It
makes programs hard to read: you can't rely on what the
program says, but on what its instructions will become in the
future.  For these reasons, self modifying code is now
considered to be bad programming practice.
   
If a program modifies itself, you can't have one copy of the
program in memory and allow it to be shared by several users.
For example, it's common now to have a web browser open with
several tabs.  Each tab is served by an independent process
(a separate running instance of a program that updates the
window showing the web page).  If you have 5 tabs open, there
are 5 processes, each running the same machine language code,
and there's only one copy of that in memory.  This wouldn't
work if the program modified itself!
   
Self modifying code leads to security holes: if a hacker has
the ability to change your machine language code in memory,
they could make your own program act against you.
   
Modern computers use a technique called *segmentation* that
prevents a program from modifying itself.  This leads to
increased reliability and security.
   
<<strange execute anchor>>
Some computers have a facility that allows you to gain the
power of self modifying code without actually modifying the
code in memory.  The idea is to have an instruction *execute
R1,x[R0]* which calculates the logical or of the two operands
and then executes the result; x is the address of an
instruction and R1 contains the modification to it.  The
modified instruction is executed, but there is no change to
the machine code in memory.  This idea was used in the IBM
360 and its successors.  However, as the design of effective
addresses has become more sophisticated, the execute
instruction is rarely needed, and most modern computers don't
provide it.

** Breakpoints

When you are testing or debugging a program, you may need to
execute many instructions before reaching the point you're
interested in.  Some programs execute thousands of
instructions just to initialize.  It's infeasible to step
through all those instructions, yet if you just run at full
speed you won't be able to see what's happening in the
section you are working on.

The solution is to run the program at full speed but to force
it to stop when it reaches a specific instruction.  This is
called a /breakpoint/.  When the program stops at the
breakpoint, you can examine the registers and memory, and
step through instructions from that point.  At any time you
can click Run and full speed execution resumes, until either
another breakpoint is encountered or the program terminates.

Both a breakpoint and a halt instruction (trap R0,R0,R0) will
stop execution of the program.  The difference is that after
a breakpoint you can click Step or Run to continue, but after
halt the program cannot execute any more instructions until
you boot the processor again.

There are two ways to set a breakpoint:
- /Trap break/: Insert an instruction into the program that
  breaks execution at that point.
- /External break/: Define a breakpoint in the user
  interface, without modifying the program.

Both forms are useful.  Most of the time, while debugging a
program, a trap break is easier and more convenient.
However, if you don't want to modify the program or
reassemble it, or if you realise that you need a breakpoint
after execution has already started, then an external break
is better.

*** Trap break

A trap break is a trap instruction whose first operand
register contains the value 4.  The other operand registers
are ignored.  When this instruction is executed, the emulator
will stop execution, and you can resume execution later by
clicking Step or Run.

Suppose you want to check what the load instruction is doing
in this code:

#+BEGIN_SRC Sigma16 exports: code
    ...
    add    R1,R2,R3
    load   R4,x[R1]
    ...
#+END_SRC

Insert a breakpoint just /before/ the instruction you want to
examine.  The breakpoint requires two instructions.  The
first instruction loads the break code into some register
(say R9 but it doesn't matter which), and the second
instruction is a trap which performs the break.  The first
operand is the register that contains the break code, and the
other two operands are ignored, so we can just use R0.

#+BEGIN_SRC Sigma16 exports: code
    ...
    add    R1,R2,R3
    lea    R9,4       ; R9 := trap break code
    trap   R9,R0,R0   ; breakpoint
    load   R4,x[R1]
    ...
#+END_SRC

Now you can run the program at full speed, but when it
executes the trap instruction, the emulator will stop.  Since
the trap instruction has just executed, it will be
highlighted in red, and the instruction you're interested in
-- the load -- will be highlighted in blue.  You can single
step for a while, and click Run again at any time to resume
full speed execution.

A common technique is to put a trap break at the beginning of
a loop.  By clicking Run repeatedly, you can step through the
loop iterations.

For an example of a long running program with a trap break,
see Examples / Core / Testing / Looper.

*** External break
   
An external break tells the emulator to perform a breakpoint
without modifying the program.  Use these steps to set an
external break:

1. Find the address of the instruction to stop at: look at
   the assembly listing, find the instruction, and the
   listing gives its address.
2. Go to the processor page, click Boot and then click
   Breakpoint.
3. A small window will appear; type in the breakpoint
   address.  It must be a hexadecimal address in assembly
   language format: it must begin with a $ and then contain
   four hex digits.  No other characters may be present, not
   even white space.
4. Click Refresh.  This parses the address you entered and
   remembers it.  (If you change the address in the window,
   click Refresh again.)
5. Click Enable.  This turns on the breakpoint.
6. Click CLose.  The breakpoint popup window will disappear
   so you can see the Processor again.

Now click Run and the program will execute at full speed.
When the pc register is equal to the breakpoint address, the
emulator will stop.  Then you can Step or Run to continue
execution.

As long as the breakpoint is enabled, execution will stop
every time that location is encountered.  To prevent this,
open the breakpoint popup again and click Disable.

* Standard architecture tutorials

The standard architecture provides additional instructions
that simplify many programming tasks, such as logic,
functions, and procedures.  It also provides additional
registers that control system functions, such as interrupts.
The standard architecture supports systems programming,
including emulators, interpreters, and operating system
kernels.  There are assembler directives that simplify large
scale programming, modules, linking, and relocation.

/Some of the instructions in the standard architecture are
under development and may be changed in future versions./

** Defining symbols with equ

Sometimes a program needs to use a constant.  For example,
you may need to use an unusual logic function that doesn't
have a built-in pseudoinstruction.  There are
pseudoinstructions for the most common logic operations:

#+BEGIN_SRC Sigma16 exports: code
   andb   R2,R7,9,13      ; R2.9 := R2.9 and R7.13
#+END_SRC

But suppose you want to use a less common logic function (for
example, nand) that doesn't have a pseudoinstruction.  You
can use the general logic instruction and specify the
encoding of the logic function you need.  The encoding for
the nand function is 14, so you need this instruction:

#+BEGIN_SRC Sigma16 exports: code
   logicb R2,R7,9,13,14   ; R2.9 := R2.9 nand R7.13
#+END_SRC

However, it's poor programming style to use magic constants
like 14 in your program.  It's easy to get them wrong, it
makes the code harder to understand, someone else reading the
program will wonder what the 14 means, and you might even
forget it yourself.

The assembler provides the *equ* statement for defining
symbols.  The symbol you're defining goes in the label field.
The operation is equ, and the operand is the value of the
symbol.  Thus you can write "nand equ 14" to define the
symbol:

#+BEGIN_SRC Sigma16 exports: code
nand equ     14             ; logic code for nand
#+END_SRC

Now you can write nand instead of 14:

#+BEGIN_SRC Sigma16 exports: code
   logicb R2,R7,9,13,nand  ; R2.9 := R2.9 nand R7.13
#+END_SRC

An equ statement must appear before any use of the symbol
that it defines.

This kind of statement, which doesn't generate an instruction
but merely gives the assembler some additional information,
is called a directive.  It is not a machine instruction.

In a program that does lots of logic, you could define the
logic functions near the beginning of the program:

#+BEGIN_SRC Sigma16 exports: code
; Symbolic names for common logic function codes
invx equ     12
and  equ     1
or   equ     7
xor  equ     6
nand equ     14
nor  equ     8
xnor equ     9
#+END_SRC

There are many applications for the equ statement, besides
defining logic function constants.  You can give a symbolic
name to condition code flags you need, and for flags in
system control registers, and for the indices of fields in
your application program.  If you have size constants, such
as the number of elements in an array or the size of a stack
or heap, you can define them with equ.

If you want to load the value of an equ symbol into a
register, use lea:

#+BEGIN_SRC Sigma16 exports: code
     lea    R3,nand[R0]  ; R3 := code for nand logic function
#+END_SRC

** Some notations for convenience

There are several shortcuts that can be useful for
experienced programmers, especially when working on large
programs.  But when you're starting out, it's better not to
use these techniques.

*** ; before comment is optional if operand field exists

It isn't required to have a semicolon ; before every comment.
If an assembly language statement has an operation field and
an operand field, then everything after the operand field is
taken to be a comment, so the semicolon is not required.

#+BEGIN_SRC Sigma16 exports: code
     lea   R3,42[R0]    ; This is a comment
     load  R5,xyz[R0]   and this is also a comment
#+END_SRC

Although most assembly language statements have an operand
field, some do not.  In these cases, the semicolon is
required to indicate a comment.

It's good style to use a semicolon consistently to indicate a
comment, even where it wouldn't be required.

*** [R0] is assumed if it's omitted

In an RX instruction, if you omit the [Reg] after the
displacement, the assembler will automatically use [R0].
Thus lea R3,42 is an abbreviation for the complete form, lea
R3,42[R0].  The following two assembly language statements
describe the same instruction (their machine language code is
identical):

#+BEGIN_SRC Sigma16 exports: code
     lea  R3,42[R0]   ; R3 := 42
     lea  R3,42       ; R3 := 42
#+END_SRC

You can write the instruction either way; both are translated
to exactly the same machine language, and they execute
exactly the same way.  These are also equivalent:

#+BEGIN_SRC Sigma16 exports: code
     jumplt loop[R0]  ; if < then goto loop
     jumplt loop      ; if < then goto loop
#+END_SRC

** Common logic operations

The Sigma16 architecture provides two general logic
instructions: logicf operates on fields within a word, and
logicb operates on individual bits.  Those two general
instructions implement all possible logic functions on two
operands, not just inv, and, or, xor.  See the Architecture
section below for an explanation of logicf and logicb.

To simplify programming, Sigma16 also provides
pseudoinstructions for commonly used logic operations on
words and bits.  These are described below, and they are
sufficient for many applications.  For each
pseudoinstruction, the assembler generates an equivalent
logicf or logicb instruction.

*** Word logic

Word logic operations are "bitwise": bit $i$ of the result
depends on bit $i$ of each operand, and does not depend on
bits at any other index.  There are pseudoinstructions for
the most common word logic operations: invw, andw, orw, xorw.

The invw pseudoinstruction inverts all the bits in a
register:

#+BEGIN_SRC Sigma16 exports: code
     lea   R3,$f0f0[R0]   ; R3 := f0f0
     invw  R3             ; R3 := 0f0f
#+END_SRC

The other word logic pseudoinstructions take two register
operands.  They calculate the result and place the result in
the first operand register, overwriting its previous value.
There is not a separate destination register, as in the add
instruction.

For example, andw R1,R2 calculates the logical /and/ of R1
and R2, and places the result in the destination register R1.

#+BEGIN_SRC Sigma16 exports: code
     lea   R1,$f0f0[R0]   ; R1 := f0f0
     lea   R2,$00ff[R0]   ; R2 := 00ff
     andw  R1,R2          ; R1 := 00f0
#+END_SRC

The orw (logical inclusive or) and xorw (logical exclusive
or) instructions are similar.

#+BEGIN_SRC Sigma16 exports: code
     lea   R1,$f0f0[R0]   ; R1 := f0f0
     lea   R2,$00ff[R0]   ; R2 := 00ff
     orw   R1,R2          ; R1 := f0ff
     xorw  R1,R2          ; R1 := f000
#+END_SRC

*** Bit logic

There are also pseudoinstructions that perform logic on two
individual bits, which may be at any index in any register.
The result overwrites the first operand.  For example, andb
R1,R2,3,9 calculates R1.3 and R2.9 and stores the result in
R1.3.  Here are some examples:

#+BEGIN_SRC Sigma16 exports: code
   lea     R1,$00ff[R0]   ; R1 := 00ff
   lea     R2,$00f0[R0]   ; R2 := 00f0
   andb  R1,R2,3,9        ; R1 := 00f7
;       (R1.3 := R1.3 and R2.9 = 1 and 0 = 0)
   orb  R1,R2,11,5        ; R1 := 08f7
;       (R1.11 := R1.11 or R2.5 = 0 or 1 = 1)
   xorb  R1,R2,4,6        ; R1 := 08e7
;       (R1.4 := R1.4 xor R2.6 = 1 xor 1 = 0)
#+END_SRC

** Bit manipulation

There are several instructions that treat a word as just a
string of bits, not as a number.  Some of these operate on
individual bits in a word, some operate on fields within a
word, and some operate on the entire word.

*** Accessing individual bits

You can set an individual bit in a register at a specified
index to 0 using clearb.  The first operand is a register,
and the second operand is the index of the bit.  All other
bits in the register remain unchanged.  So clearb R3,2 makes
R3.2 zero (that is, the bit at index 2 in R3).  All the other
bits in R3 remain unchanged.

#+BEGIN_SRC Sigma16 exports: code
   lea     R3,$ffff[R0]  ; R3 := ffff
   clearb  R3,2          ; R3 := fffb  (R3.2 := 0)
#+END_SRC

The setb pseudoinstruction is similar, but it makes the
specified bit 1.

#+BEGIN_SRC Sigma16 exports: code
   add     R4,R0,R0      ; R4 := 0000
   setb    R4,6          ; R4 := 0040  (R4.6 := 1)
#+END_SRC

*** Shifting

There are two shift instructions, which shift the word in Re
by f bits (to left or right) and place the result into Rd.
These are logical shifts: the bits that are shifted out are
discarded, and bits shifted into the word are always 0.
     
#+BEGIN_SRC Sigma16 exports: code
  shiftl Rd,Re,f  ; Rd := Re shifted left by f bits
  shiftr Rd,Re,f  ; Rd := Re shifted right by f bits
#+END_SRC

Here are some examples; the comments show the expected result
in both hexadecimal and as bits.

#+BEGIN_SRC Sigma16 exports: code
  lea    R1,2[R0]  ; R2 = 0002   0000 0000 0000 0010
  shiftl R5,R1,4   ; R5 = 0020   0000 0000 0010 0000
  shiftl R6,R1,13  ; R6 = 4000   0100 0000 0000 0000
  shiftr R7,R6,3   ; R7 = 0800   0000 1000 0000 0000
  shiftr R7,R7,11  ; R7 = 0001   0000 0000 0000 0001
#+END_SRC

*** Extracting fields

A common situation, especially in systems programming, is
that you have a word that contains several fields.  A machine
language instruction is like that; also a network packet
contains a number of fields.  The sizes of the fields, and
their positions within a word, can be anything.  Software,
especially systems programming, often needs to be able to
extract a field from a word and put it somwhere else so it
can be used.

It's possible to obtain any field from a register, and put it
somewhere in another register, using a sequence of shift and
logic instructions (particularly shiftl, shiftr, andw, orw).
However, these sequences of instructions are error prone,
hard to read, and they execute frequently in the inner loop
of many systems programs.

Sigma16 provides an instruction /extract/ which solves this
problem with just one instruction.  It allows you to extract
an arbitrary field from a register and put it into an
arbitrary location in another register.

The extract instruction takes operands that specify the
source register (which contains the field you're interested
in), the destination register (where it will put the field),
the location of the field in the source register (specifed as
the index of the rightmost and leftmost bits in the field),
and the location where you want to put the field in the
destination register.

This instruction copies 4 bits from R1.4:7 to R2:8:11:

#+BEGIN_SRC Sigma16 exports: code
   extract  R2,R1,8,4,7   ; R2.8:11 := R1.4:7
#+END_SRC

In this example, the operands are:
- R2 is the destination register
- R1 is the source register
- 8 is the index of the rightmost bit in the destination
  where the field will be placed at ascending bit indices
- 4 is the index of the rightmost bit of the field in the
  source register
- 7 is the index of the leftmost bit of the field in the
  source register

This instruction is equivalent to the following (although it
is just one instruction, not four instructions):

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   R2.8  :=  R1.4
   R2.9  :=  R1.5
   R2.10 :=  R1.6
   R2.11 :=  R1.7 
#+END_EXAMPLE

The extract instruction modifies only the specified bits in
the destination register; the other bits remain unchanged.
Here is an example:

#+BEGIN_SRC Sigma16 exports: code
   lea      R1,$00f0[R0]  ; R1 = 00f0
   add      R2,R0,R0      ; R2 = 0000   
   extract  R2,R1,8,4,7   ; R2 = 0f00  R2.8:11 := R1.4:7
#+END_SRC

** Saving and restoring contiguous registers

There are several situations where a program needs to store a
sequence of registers into consecutive memory
locations. Later the registers must be reloaded from the
block of memory.  One example is a procedure call; another
example is gaining access to all the fields of a record.
These operations are supported by the save and restore
instructions.

The following save instruction stores R3, R4, ..., R9 into
consecutive memory locations, starting at 5[R14]:

#+BEGIN_SRC Sigma16 exports: code
    save    R3,R9,5[R14]   ; save R3 to R9
#+END_SRC

The save is equivalent to a sequence of individual store
instructions:

#+BEGIN_SRC Sigma16 exports: code
    store   R3,5[R14]
    store   R4,6[R14]
    store   R5,7[R14]
    store   R6,8[R14]
    store   R7,9[R14]
    store   R8,10[R14]
    store   R9,11[R14]
#+END_SRC

To get the values from memory back into the registers, use
this restore instruction:

#+BEGIN_SRC Sigma16 exports: code
     restore R3,R9,5[R14]  ; restore R3 to R9
#+END_SRC

The restore is equivalent to a sequence of individual load
instructions:

#+BEGIN_SRC Sigma16 exports: code
    load    R3,5[R14]
    load    R4,6[R14]
    load    R5,7[R14]
    load    R6,8[R14]
    load    R7,9[R14]
    load    R8,10[R14]
    load    R9,11[R14]
#+END_SRC

Using save and restore makes the code shorter and more
readable, and it's easier to check that the save an restore
match each other.

** Branching to pc-relative address (???)

A branch instruction transfers control to a specified
location, similar to a jump.  The difference is in how the
location to jump to is specified: in a jump, the address of
the destination is specified as the effective address, while
in a branch the destination is specifed as an offset to be
added to (or subtracted from) the value in the pc register.

There are advantages for both jumps and branches, and many
computers have both.  One big advantage of a branch is that
it makes the machine language code independent of the
position of the program in memory.  See the section on the
Linker.

A branch can either go forward, to a higher address, or
backward, to a lower address.  Furthermore, a branch can be
unconditional or conditional.

- brf branch forward unconditional
- brb branch backward unconditional
- brfc0 branch forward if Rd = 0
- brfc1 branch forward if Rd /= 0
- brbc0 branch backward if Rd = 0
- brbc1 branch backward if Rd /= 0

The unconditional branches take one operand, which is a
constant called the offset.

A *module* is a section of a program; it may be the complete
program or just a part of it.  A module may be saved in a
file or it may simply be text in the editor buffer.  A
program may consist of just one module, or it can be split
between several files.

The Editor page contains a text area called the *editor
buffer*.  When you launch Sigma16, there is one module whose
text is empty and displayed in the editor buffer.  You can
type a program (to be precise, a module) into the editor
buffer.  When you switch to the Assembler page, the Assemble
button will translate the text in the editor buffer to
machine language, which you can execute on the Processor
page.

After entering a program in the editor buffer, you should
save it to a file.  Click Save and the text in the editor
buffer will be written to a file on your computer.  Depending
on how the system is configured, there may be a dialogue box
asking you for a file name, or a generic default file name
may be used (for example, "S16DownloadFile (2).txt" or
something similar).

# This file will be saved in the default Downloads directory as
# configured in your browser.

# The reason there is limited control over the name of the
# saved file, and the directory where it is placed, is that
# web browsers enforce strict limitations on the ability of
# applications to access your file system.  That's a good
# feature of browsers -- you don't want a malicious web page
# to start reading, deleting, or corrupting your files -- but
# it does make it inconvenient to save your edited assembly
# programs.

Another approach is to use a separate text editor, and to
copy/paste text between the external editor and the Editor
page on Sigma16.

To create a new module without destroying the existing one,
click *New* in the editor page.  This will make a new module
with empty text and display that in the editor buffer, so any
text you had there will disappear.  However, that text isn't
lost, it's just hidden, and to get it back you just need to
select the previous module.

The *Modules* page shows a list of all the modules and allows
you to select one to work on.  The modules are shown in small
sections separated by horizontal lines.  The modules are
numbered starting from 0, so if there are n modules their
numbers go from 0 to n-1.  For each module, the module number
is shown, followed by some buttons to operate on that module,
and some information about it.  The first few lines of the
module are shown.  If you follow good programming style,
where the first rew lines of each module identify the
program, you'll be able to see at a glance what each module
is without visiting it in the editor.

Several buttons appear for each module in the list.  At any
time, one of the modules is *selected*. Click the Select
button for any module to select that one.  The selected
module number is highlighted in red, and when you go to the
Editor page the text of the selected module appears in the
editor buffer.  This means you can have several programs open
at the same time, and just switch from one to the other using
the Select buttons in the Modules page.

You can also get rid of a module by clicking its Close
button.  This will delete its text, so it may be a good idea
to select it and download it in the Editor before closing it.

So far we have just created new modules by clicking *New* (in
either the Editor page or the Modules page).  You can also
read files on your computer into Sigma16.  Click *Choose
files* and a dialogue box will pop up.  You can select one or
more files, and these will now appear in the list of modules.

If a module was created by reading it from a file, its entry
in the list contains an extra *Refresh* button.  Clicking
this will reread the file and you won't need to use the file
chooser dialogue box again.


* The Sigma16 processor architecture
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: sec-processor
:END:

Sigma16 contains a set of registers, an arithmetic logic unit
(ALU) and functional units for arithmetic calculations, a
memory, a memory management unit that provides virtual
memory, an interrupt system, and an Input/Output controller
using direct memory access (DMA).

# ** System control registers
# [[./figures/control-block-pc.png]]

** Implementations

The Sigma16 software application contains a complete
programming environment, using emulation to implement the
processor.  The programming environment includes a file
manager, editor, assembler, linker, and emulator, and it
provides Input/Output and secondary storage.  The software
runs in a web browser, and does not require any installation.
There are also command line tools which can be installed on a
local computer, but they are not necessary.

There is also a digital circuit, specified in a functional
hardware description language, which implements the Core
architecture.  The circuit specification is executable, and
Core programs can be executed by simulating the circuit.  The
circuit is suitable for implementation using either an FPGA
or a custom VLSI design.  In simulation, the simulation
driver provides Input/Output, and in a hardware realisation
these would be provided by I/O hardware.

** Subsystems

A *register* is a digital circuit that can retain one word of
data.  A new value can be loaded into a register, and the
current contents may be read out.  Registers are fast, and
most computation is performed using the registers.  Sigma16
contains several groups of registers; each group is displayed
in a box on the Processor tab.

- The *Register File* is an array of 16 registers named R0,
  R1, $\ldots$, R15.  These registers are accessible to the
  machine language program.  Programs use the register file
  to hold variables that are currently in use.
- The *Control* registers (pc, ir, adr) keep track of the
  instruction that is currently executing.
- The *System* registers control the system status and
  interrupts.
- The *Virtual Memory* registers are used for memory
  management.

The *memory* is an array of $2^{16}$ words.  Each word in the
memory is identified by an *address*, which is a 16-bit
natural number.  The memory is similar to the register file,
but significantly slower and much larger.

*Computational units.* The ALU (arithmetic and logic unit) is
a circuit that can do arithmetic, such as addition,
subtraction, comparison, and some other operations More
complex operations, such as multiplication and division, are
provided by functional units.

The *Input/Output* system can transfer data between the
computer and the outside world.

** Words

In Sigma16, a *word* is a sequence of 16 bits.  Occasionally
we will also refer to a *double word* (a sequence of 32
bits).  A a *generic word* is a sequence of bits of arbitrary
length.  The system does not use bytes (a byte is 8 bits) or
extended words (64 bits).

The hardware components in Sigma16 are mostly 16 bits wide.
Each addressable memory location is a word, and a memory
address is a word.  Each register is a word.

By itself, a word has no inherent meaning: it is just a
sequence of bits.  Some instructions operate on a word
without regard to what it means: for example, several
instructions copy a word from one place to another and it
doesn't matter what the word means.  Other instructions act
on a word assuming that it represents some particular
primitive data type.  For example, integer arithmetic assumes
that the word represents an integer, while address arithmetic
assumes that the word represents a natural number.

Sigma16 supports natural numbers, and integers, which are
represented as words.  It also supports Booleans, which are
represented as a bit within a word.  Addresses and characters
are represented as natural numbers.

*** Indexing bits in a word

The bits of a word are indexed from right to left, starting
with index 0.  The least significant (rightmost) bit has
index 0, and the most significant bit (leftmost) has
index 15.

The notations $x_i$ and =x.i= both mean the bit with index
$i$ in the word $x$, for $0 \leq i \leq 15$.  For example,
$x_0$ is the rightmost bit and $x_{15}$ is the leftmost bit.
When used in an instruction, a bit index is specified as a
4-bit binary number $i$ such that $0 \leq i \leq 15$.

The following table shows the indices of all the bits in a
word.  The vertical bars break the word into groups of 4
bits.  This grouping corresponds to the representation of the
word in hex notation.

$$\fbox{$\ x_{15}\> x_{14}\> x_{13}\> x_{12}
  \ \vert\ x_{11}\> x_{10}\> x_{9}\> x_{8}$}$$

$$\fbox{$ \ \vert\ x_{7}\> x_{6}\> x_{5}\> x_{4}
  \ \vert\ x_{3}\> x_{2}\> x_{1}\> x_{0}
  \ $}$$

*** Fields  

A bit field is a contiguous sequence of bits in a word.  It
is specified by two numbers: the indices of the rightmost and
leftmost bits in the field.

*** Natural numbers

The natural numbers are $0, 1, 2, \ldots$, so all natural
numbers are nonnegative.  Sigma16 represents natural numbers
as binary, and uses them to represent memory addresses.  The
binary value of an $n$ bit generic word $x$ is

$$binval (x) = \sum_{0 \leq i < n} x_i * 2^i$$

For a word of 16 bits, natural numbers are restricted to the
range from 0 through $2^{16}-1$; that is, from 0 through
65,535.  For a double word (32 bits), natural numbers are
restricted to the range from 0 through $2^{32}-1$; that is,
from 0 through 4,294,967,295.

A natural number (and hence a binary number) cannot be
negative.  If you need numbers that can be negative or
positive, you must use an integer.  The arithmetic
instructions in Sigma16 operate on integers, but address
arithmetic is performed in binary.

*** Integers

Integers are represented using two's complement notation.  If
the leftmost (most significant) bit of a word is 0, its two's
complement value is the same as its binary value.  If the
leftmost bit is 1, the two's complement value is negative.

Any two's complement number (with one exception) can be
negated by inverting all the bits (replace 0 by 1 and vice
versa) and then adding 1, discarding any overflow.  The sole
exception is that if the smallest negative number ($-2^{15}$)
is negated, the result is overflow because the largest
positive integer representable in 16 bit two's complement is
$2^{15}-1$.

For example, consider $x$ = 1111 1010.  Since the leftmost
bit is 1, we know that $x < 0$.  We can negate $x$ by
inverting the bits, obtaining 0000 0101.  Adding 1 gives 0000
0110 which is 6.  Since $-x = 6$, we conclude that $x = -6$.

*** Notations for a word

Assembly language provides several notations for expressing
the value of a word.
# If a numeric value is out of range it is truncated.

- A natural number between 0 and 65,535 (2^16 - 1)
- An integer between -32,768 and 32,767 (-2^15 and 2^15 - 1)
- A 4-digit hexadecimal constant, where the digits are 0-9
  a-f.  The constant is preceded by $, for example $3e8c.

In assembly language programs, hexadecimal constants are
written with a preceding $ sign (e.g. $3b2f).  This is
necessary to avoid ambiguity: 1234 is a decimal number and
$1234 is a hexadecimal number, and they denote different
words.

Assembly language always requires a $ before a hexadecimal
constant.  For displays of the machine state, in contexts
where there is no ambiguity, the $ may be omitted.  For
example, the user interface displays register and memory
contents as hexadecimal without the leading $.  However, the
$ is always required for hex constants in assembly language
programs.

** Memory

The memory is a hardware array of words that are accessed by
address.  A memory address is 16 bits wide, and there is one
memory location corresponding to each address, so there are
2^16 = 64k memory locations (1k = 1,024).  Each memory
location is a 16-bit word.

Instructions specify memory addresses in two parts: the
*displacement*, which is a word representing a binary number,
and the *index*, which is one of the registers in the
register file.  For example, a memory address could be
specified as $003c[R5]; the displacement is 003c and the
index is R5.

When the instruction is executed, the computer calculates the
*effective address* by adding the value of the displacement
and the value in the index register.  If R5 contains 2, then
the effective address of $003c[R5] is 003e.

This scheme may seem more complicated than simply specifying
the address directly, but it is flexible.  If the machine
language just gave the address as a single binary number, it
would be limited to accessing simple static variables.  The
effective address mechanism is simple to implement in
hardware, as you can see in the digital circuit processor,
yet it allows the implementation of static variables, local
variables, records, arrays, pointers and linked data
structures, jump tables, and more.  These techniques are
described later.

** Registers

*** Register file

The *register file* is a set of 16 general registers, each of
which holds a 16 bit word.  A register is referenced by a
4-bit binary number.  In assembly language, we use the
notations R0, R1, R2, ..., R9, R10, R11, R12, R13, R14, R15
to refer to the registers.  The state of the register file
can be written as a table showing the value of each register:

| Register | Contents |
|----------+----------|
| R0       | 0000     |
| R1       | fffe     |
| R2       | 13c4     |
| ...      | ...      |
| R14      | 03c8     |
| R15      | 0020     |

Sigma16 is a load/store style architecture.  All calculations
are carried out in the register file, and explicit load and
store instructions must be used to copy data between the
memory and the register file.

R0 and R15 are special.  The other registers, R1 through R14,
may be used for any purpose.

- R0 always contains the constant 0.

It is legal to perform an instruction that attempts to load
some other value into R0, but the register will still contain
0 after executing such an instruction.  Such an instruction
will simply have no lasting effect.

- R15 is the condition code register.

*** Condition code
  
Several instructions produce status information: the result
of a comparison, whether there was an overflow, etc.  This
information is automatically loaded into R15, which is also
called the /condition code/.  The description of each
instruction states whether R15 is modified, and what goes
into it.

Each bit in the condition code (R15) is a Boolean that
specifies whether a specific condition is false (0) or true
(1).  The bits are indexed from bit 0 (rightmost, or least
significant) to bit 15 (the leftmost, or most significant).
Condition code bits are sometimes called /flags/.  Each flag
gives the status of a relation or event.  If the flag is True
(1) the relation holds or the event has occurred.  If the
flag is False (0) the relation does not hold, or the event
has not occurred.

One way to use flags in the condition code is to control
conditional jumps.  The jumpc0 and jumpc1 instructions are
conditional jumps that use a flag in R15 to decide whether to
jump:
- Use jumpc0 to jump if the Boolean is False
- Use jumpc1 to jump if the Boolean is True

Both jumpc0 and jumpc1 take two operands.  The first is a
natural number from 0 to 15, which gives the index of a flag
in the condition code.  The second is an address to jump to,
specified as displacement[index].  The indices of the flags
are given below.

The two conditional jumps (jumpc0 and jumpc1) let you jump
depending on either the truth or falsity of a condition.  For
example, the flag at index 4 denotes integer less than.  The
fist pair of instructions below jumps if the less than
condition holds, and the second pair jumps if the less than
condition is false.  This is equivalent to jumping if the
"greater than or equal" condition holds.

#+BEGIN_SRC Sigma16 exports: code
   cmp     R8,R9
   jumpc1  4,xyz[R0] ; if R8 < R9 then goto xyz
   ...
   cmp     R8,R9
   jumpc0  4,xyz[R0] ; if R8 >= R9 then goto xyz
#+END_SRC

Programs usually use pseudoinstructions rather than the
actual machine instructions jumpc0 and jumpc1.  For example,
the following two instructions are equivalent: the assembler
generates exactly the same machine language code for them.

#+BEGIN_SRC Sigma16 exports: code
   jumpc1  4,xyz[R0] ; if R8 < R9 then goto xyz
   jumplt  xyz[R0]   ; if R8 < R9 then goto xyz
#+END_SRC

In effect, the pseudoinstruction lets you omit the flag index
and instead to indicate the condition you want in the
mnemonic.  It's easier to remember that less than is
indicated by lt than by 4.

Another way to use condition code flags is to save them as
Boolean variables and perform logic operations on them.  In
this case it's best to copy a flag to another register, using
copyb.  From there you can evaluate logic expressions using
andb, orb, xorb, and logicb.  It isn't a good idea to keep
Boolean variables in R15 for a long time, because many
instructions will modify it.

Before doing logic operations on condition code bits,
consider whether "short circuit" evaluation, with a separate
comparison followed by conditional jump for each relation, is
more appropriate.

There is not just one flag for "less than" and another for
"greater than".  There are separate flags for integers
(represented as two's complement) and natural numbers
(represented as binary).  This is necessary because the
relation between two words sometimes depends on the type of
the data.  For example, consider the word ffff (all 1 bits).
On its own, ffff is just a word of bits and has no inherent
meaning.

- If ffff is interpreted as a natural number (i.e. binary),
  it is positive and has the value 65,535, and ffff > 0000.
- If ffff is interpreted as an integer (i.e. two's
  complement), then it is negative and has the value -1, and
  ffff < 0000.

The cmp instruction compares two words, and evaluates five
relations between the words: equality, less than for both
natural and integer, and greater than for both natural and
integer.  These evaluations are performed simultaneously,
using parallelism in the ALU circuit, and the result of each
is recorded in the corresponding flag in the condition code.

#+BEGIN_SRC Sigma16 exports: code
    cmp    R5,R6
    jumpc1 3,lessNat[R0]  ; if R5 <Nat R6 then goto lessNat
    ...
    cmp    R7,R8
    jumpc1 4,LessInt[R0]  ; if R7 <Int R8 then goto lessInt
#+END_SRC

Thus you don't specify the types of the operands in the cmp
instruction.  Instead, you select the condition code flag
that corresponds to the types.

Each flag has a short 1-character name to enable it to be
displayed compactly in the user interface.  A naming
convention is that flags for integers (two's complement) have
lower case letters, while flags for natural numbers (binary)
have upper case letters.  For example:

- l means < for integers
- L means < for natural numbers
- g means > for integers
- G means > for natural numbers

Equality is the same regardless of type.  If two words
consist of exactly the same bits, then they have the same
value as integers, natural numbers, characters, addresses,
and for any other possible type as well.  Therefore there is
only one flag for equality, and its symbol is =.

Register R15 is also called the /condition code/.  Some
instructions modify a bit in the condition code to indicate
the results of comparisons, overflow, carry, other special
data, and various errors.  Instructions that operate on
registers can access R15 as usual. There are also some
instructions that implicitly access R15 without specifying it
(for example, jumpc0 and jumpc1).  Since many instructions
modify the condition code as a side effect, programs should
not use R15 to hold variables.

The following table lists all the condition code flags.
- Index is the bit position of the flag in the condition
  code.  Bits are numbered from right to left, starting
  with 0.
- Symbol: the graphical user interface shows the symbol for
  each bit that is 1.  For example, if G is displayed after a
  comparison of two words, this means that > holds if the
  words are interpreted as natural numbers but not if they
  are interpreted as integers.  However, if G> is displayed,
  the comparison result is greater than for both integer and
  two's complement representation.
- Meaning: Description using English or mathematical notation
- Hex: The value of the condition code word assuming the
  given flag is true and all others are false.  If several
  flags are true, the condition code register will be the
  logic or of the hex values of the true flags.  For example,
  suppose the words 00a3 is compared with 00c5.  The
  comparison result is L (less than for naturals) and also l
  (less than for integers).  So the condition code will
  contain 0008 + 0010 = 0018.

There is an exception for division by zero, but no
corresponding flag in the condition code.  The reason is that
the div instruction places the remainder in R15, so the
condition code isn't available to represent division by 0.
You can use an interrupt to detect division by 0, and you can
test explicity for division by 0 by using jumpz specifying
the register containing the divisor before executing the div
instruction.

**** The ordinary general registers: R1 through R14

Registers R1 through R14 have no special properties defined
by the machine.  A program can use them for any purpose.

However, there are some programming conventions that use
certain registers for special purposes.  The hardware does
not enforce, or even know about, these conventions, and you
do not have to follow the conventions in programming.
However, it is necessary to obey the conventions in order to
use the standard software libraries in your program.  See the
section on Programming for a discussion of these standard
usage conventions.

*** Instruction control registers

The instruction control registers enable the processor to
keep track of the state of the running program.  These
registers are rarely used directly by the machine language
program, but they are essential for keeping track of the
execution of the program, and some instructions use them
directly.

**** pc -- program counter

The PC (program counter) register contains the address of the
next instruction to be executed (/not/ the address of the
instruction currently being executed).  The name is
illogical, but "program counter" is the traditional name and
Sigma16 sticks with standard terminology.

**** ir -- instruction register

The IR contains the instruction that is currently executing.
If the instruction is RRR format, the entire instruction is
in the IR.  The other instruction formats require two words;
the first word is in the IR and the second word is in the ADR
register.

**** adr -- address register

If the instruction currently executing is RRR format, the ADR
register is not used, and its content is just whatever was
left over from previous instructions.

If the instruction currently executing is RX or EXP format,
the ADR register contains the second word of the instruction.
Furthermore, for RX instructions the effective address is
calculated and replaces the second word of the instruction.

**** status -- system status register

The status register contains flags that specify the current
execution mode of the processor.

#+BEGIN_EXPORT html
<div style="overflow-x: auto">
#+END_EXPORT

| Index | Symbol | Meaning                        |  Hex |
|-------+--------+--------------------------------+------|
|     0 | U/S    | 0: user state. 1: system state | 0001 |
|     1 | E      | 1: interrupts enabled          | 0002 |

#+BEGIN_EXPORT html
</div>
#+END_EXPORT

If the processor is in system state, any instruction can be
executed.  If it is in user state, executing a privileged
instruction causes an interrupt.

When the system is started by booting a program, the status
is set to system state.  If the program is just a standalone
program (such as the simple examples), you can ignore the
system state.  If an operating system has been booted, the OS
should put the processor into user state when it gives a time
slice to a user process.

If the status register indicates that interrupts are enabled,
and an interrupt request is set in the request register, than
an interrupt occurs when the current instruction is
completed.  If interrupts are not enabled, then interrupt
requests are ignored.

** Interrupts

An interrupt is a jump performed automatically by the machine
in response to an event, not by executing a jump instruction.
Interrupts are used for error detection and recovery,
input/output, concurrency, memory protection, and virtual
memory.  Most of these features are implemented by an
operating system kernel.

There are two kinds of event that can trigger an interrupt:

- An error that occurs while executing an instruction.  For
  example, an arithmetic instruction could produce a result
  that is too large to represent in a word (this is called
  overflow).  Sometimes this is called an /exception/, and
  sometimes it is called an interrupt.
- An external event that has nothing to do with the running
  program, but which needs to be handled.  For example, an
  I/O device may request an interrupt when it has completed
  an I/O operation.  This is always called an interrupt.

There are several types of interrupt.  Each type has a unique
index.  The interrupt indices serve two purposes: they
determine the interrupt priority, and they give the bit index
for the interrupt type in the mask and request registers.
The following table shows each type of interrupt and the bit
index of its flag.

</div>
#+END_EXPORT

Each type of interrupt has a priority which is determined by
its index: a lower index indicates higher priority.  Thus the
timer interrupt has the highest priority, and a stack
overflow has higher priority than integer overflow.

Interrupts take place only between execution of instructions.
When one instruction has finished, the processor checks for
interrupts before going on to the next instruction.  This
consists of the following steps:

1. If interrupts are not enabled, the check terminates and
   the next instruction is executed normally.
2. If interrupts are enabled, and there is an interrupt
   request, and the corresponding mask bit is enabled, an
   interrupt will take place.  If several types of interrupt
   meet these conditions, the one with highest priority
   (lowest index) is selected.  Let i be the index of the
   type of interrupt that was selected.
3. The processor clears the request bit for the interrupt in
   the request register, it copies the status register into
   rstat, and it copies the pc register into the rpc
   register.  Also, it loads mem[vect+2*i] into the pc
   register, and it and sets flags in the status register to
   indicate system state and interrupts disabled.
4. If the timer is running, it is stopped.
5. Now the interrupt has completed, and the next instruction
   is executed normally.  Since the pc has been modified, the
   machine has jumped to a different location.

This algorithm is performed entirely by the processor; none
of it involves software.  Although it is described as a
sequence of steps, many of these steps can be performed in
parallel, because digital circuits are inherently parallel.
If an interrupt does not take place, the time required for
the check is minimal (less than one clock cycle), so checking
for interrupts does not signicantly slow down the processor
speed.

*** mask - interrupt mask register

The mask register specifies which types of interrupt are
allowed to occur.  It contains a flag for each type of
interrupt; if the flag is 1 then the corresponding type of
interrupt can take place.  If the mask flag is 0, then that
type of interrupt will not occur even if it is requested.

*** request - interrupt request register

When an interrupt is requested, the corresponding bit is set
in the request register.  When the next instruction is
executed, the interrupt occurs if interrupts are enabled and
the corresponding mask bit is 1.

*** rstat register

When an interrupt occurs, the value of the status register is
copied into rstat.

*** rpc register

When an interrupt occurs, the value of pc is copied into rpc.
This is necessary to enable the operating system to resume
the interrupted program.

*** vect register

The interrupt vector register contains the address of a jump
table.  This is an array of jumps to interrupt handlers.

** Memory management registers

(Will be implemented in future version)


* Sigma32

/Sigma32 is experimental and under development.  It is only
partially implemented, and many details in this section are
likely to change in the future./

Sigma32 is a backward-compatible extension of Sigma16 to use 32
bit words.  It provides 32 bit arithmetic, and addresses are 32
bits so it has a much larger memory address space.

Sigma32 is backward compatible with Sigma16: every Sigma16 program
executes on Sigma32 exactly the same as on Sigma16.  Sigma32
extends the Sigma16 registers to 32 bits; the Sigma16 instructions
operate on the rightmost 16 bits of the registers.  The Sigma32
instructions are similar to their 16 bit counterparts, so learning
how to use them is straightforward.  Programs can mix 16 bit and
32 bit instructions freely.

In Sigma32, addresses are 32 bits.  Instructions from the Sigma16
instruction set, such as lea and load, generate 16-bit addresses
which are extended to 32 bits by padding on the left.

The Sigma16 memory has $2^{16}$ words (i.e. 65,536 words).
Sigma32 can address $2^{32}$ words (i.e 4,294,967,296 words).  In
practice, the actual memory size supported by an implementation of
Sigma32 will normally be much smaller than that, as it depends on
the platform running the emulator and the primary memory size of
your computer.

The Sigma16 app supports both architectures.  It runs in two
modes:
- In 16 bit mode, the registers are 16 bits.  Execting a 32 bit
  instruction triggers an invalid instruction interrupt.
- In 32 bit mode, the registers are 32 bits and all instructions
  can be used.

When launched, the app starts out in 16 bit mode.
- To switch the system to 32 bit mode, open the browser console.
  In Edge, Chrome, Opera, and some other browsers, enter *Ctrl
  Shift J*.  In the console, enter *setArch(32)*.
- To go back to the default 16 bit mode, enter *setArch(16)*.
- In the future, the GUI will provide buttons to switch
  modes.

Sigma32 instructions are represented using three formats:
- Some use RX format.
- Most 32 bit instructions are represented in EXP format
- Some Sigma32 instructions need several 5-bit fields, in order to
  index a bit within a 32 bit register. These instructions use
  EXP32 format.


* Instruction set

A note on terminology: the Sigma16 system contains a Core subset,
a full 16-bit Standard subset, and an optional 32-bit extension
called Sigma32.  The entire system, including the app which runs
in a browser or in a shell using node, is called Sigma16.

** Instruction representation

Instructions are represented in the memory of the computer using
words, just like all other kinds of data.  From the programmer's
perspective, an instruction is like a simple statement in a
programming language.  From the circuit designer's perspective,
instructions must be executed using logic gates, and the specific
way it is represented as a word of bits is important.

An instruction specifies several pieces of information.  For
example, the instruction =add R1,R2,R3= says four things: it's an
addition, the operands come from R2 and R3, and the result goes
into R1.  Therefore to represent an instruction we need to
organize a word as a collection of several *fields*.  A field is a
portion of a word that contains a small number (for example, a
register number). Each field gives one specific piece of
information about the instruction.

The particular scheme for describing an instruction as a
collection of fields is called an *instruction format*.  Like most
computers, Sigma16 has a small number of instruction formats and a
larger number of instructions.  Instruction representation is key
to both system software (compilers generate instructions) and
computer hardware (a processor is a digital circuit that decodes
and executes instructions).

The core architecture (the simplest part of the system) uses two
instruction formats: the *RRR format* for instructions that
perform calculations in the registers, and the *RX format* for
instructions that refer to a memory location.

The advanced parts of the architecture provide additional
instructions, most of which are represented with the *EXP
format*. The name EXP stands simultaneously for *expansion*
(because it provides for many additional instructions) and
*experimental* (because it allows for experimentation with the
design and implementation of new instructions).

Each instruction format has a fixed size, which is the number of
words used to represent any instruction of that format:
- RRR instructions are one word
- RX instructions are two words
- EXP instructions are two words

The first word of every instruction (for all instruction formats)
contains the following fields:

- op (bits 15-12) 4-bit opcode, determines instruction format
- d  (bits 11-8)  4-bit destination
- a  (bits 7-4)   4-bit operand a
- b  (bits 3-0)   4-bit operand b, or expanded opcode for RX
  
+-------+------+-----+-----+
|    op |    d |   a |   b |
+-------+------+-----+-----+
| 15-12 | 11-8 | 7-4 | 3-0 |
+-------+------+-----+-----+

The format of every instruction is determined by the op field.
Since this field contains 4 bits, it can specify 16 values:

- $RRR.$ If the op field is between 0 and 12 (hex 0 to hex c), the
  instruction is RRR format, and there are 13 RRR instructions.

- *Reserved.* An op field value of 13 (hex d) is reserved for
  future expansion of the architecture.

- *EXP.* If the op field is 14 (hex e) the instruction is EXP
  format and has a secondary 8-bit opcode in the a and b fields.

- *RX.* If the op field contains 15 (hex f) the instruction is RX
  format with a secondary 4-bit opcode in the b field.
 
Since an RRR instruction is one word, it contains just the op, d,
a, b fields.  If an instruction is RX or EXP format, it has a
second word whose format is described below in the sections on RX
and EXP.

** Instruction formats

Sigma16 uses expanding opcodes.  This allows for a small number of
compact 1-word instructions, as well as a larger number of
instructions that require two or more words, where more bits are
available for secondary operation codes.  The 1-word format is
RRR, and the formats that use more than one word to represent an
instruction are RX, EXP, and EXP3.

Sigma16 is designed to support projects that extend the
architecture.  For this reason, a number of opcodes in each format
are nop (no operation).  You can modify the archtecture by turning
any nop into whatever new instruction you like, and the programs
in the Examples directory will continue to run just as before.
This also means that some instructions aren't represented as
compactly as possible.  For example, the RRR nops and the RX nops
could be used for simpler representations of some of the EXP
instructions, but then it would be harder to carry out projects
that could have used RRR or RX format.  In particular, some of the
simplest extensions to the system would be to introduce a new RRR
instruction, so it's valuable to have some RRR opcodes available.


The instruction formats are:
- *RRR*
  - There are 13 RRR instructions: 0--C
  - 9 of these are defined instructions.  The rest are
    nop, and available for projects.
  - 1 word
  - first word: op,d,a,b
  - op: bits 15-12 (4 bits)
  - d: bits 11-8 (4 bits)
  - a: bits 7-4 (4 bits)
  - b: bits 3-0 (4 bits)
  - operation: op
  - primary operation code is op field.  If 0 <= op <= C, the
    instruction is RRR format and there are 13 possible RRR
    instructions.  If D <= op <= F, the instruction has a
    different format and the full operation is determined by an
    expanding opcode specified by b or ab.
- *RX*
  - There are 16 RX instructions: F,0--F,F
  - 2 words
  - operation: F,b
  - op field is always F; secondary operation code is b field
  - op,d,a,b ; disp
  - first word is same as for RRR
  - second word: disp (16 bits)
- *EXP*
  - There are up to 192 EXP instructions: E,00--E,BF
  - 2 words
  - operation: E,ab
  - op field is always E; secondary operation code is ab (8 bits)
    where 0 <= ab < F6
  - op,d,ab ; e,f,g,h
  - first word is same as for RRR, but a,b treated as a single
    8-bit field called ab
  - second word: e,f,g,h
  - e: bits 15-12 (4 bits)
  - f: bits 11-8 (4 bits)
  - g: bits 7-4 (4 bits)
  - h: bits 3-0 (4 bits)
- *EXP3*
  - There are up to 64 EXP3 instructions: E,C0--E,FF
  - 3 words
  - Not used for 16 bit instructions.  In Sigma32, used to provide
    5-bit fields for indexing a bit in a register.
  - op field is always E; secondary operation code is ab (8 bits)
    where F6 < ab <= FF
  - op,d,ab ; e,f,g,h
  - op,d,ab ; e,f,g,h ; p,q,r,s
  - first word is same as for EXP
  - second word is same as for EXP
  - third word: p,q,r,s
  - p: bits 15-11 (5 bits)
  - q: bits 10-6 (5 bits)
  - r: bits 5-1 (5 bits)
  - s: bit 0 (1 bit)

Given the first word of an instruction, the following algorithm
determines which instruction this is.  This algorithm is not
software; it is implemented directly by the processor hardware.
In other words, the algorithm is implemented as a digital circuit.
The Sigma16 app contains adA software emulator for the
architecture, which also implements the algorithm, but this is a
simulation of the processor circuit, not an ordinary software
program.

Although there are three machine language instruction formats
(RRR, RX, EXP), there is a larger set of assembly language
statement formats, because there are special syntaxes for
pseudoinstructions, and there are assembler directives that aren't
instructions at all (such as equ).  Thus there are two kinds of
format: the machine /instruction formats/, and the assembly
language instruction /statement formats/.  The assembly language
formats are described later.

*** put later and edit - Summary of Sigma16 instruction set

- The Mnemonic gives the symbolic name of the instruction
  used in assembly language

- The ISA specifies the smallest subset of the instruction
  set architecture that allows this instruction.  The Core
  subset is a minimal architecture; the Standard subset
  contains a full range of instructions

- The R15 entry indicates how the instruction uses R15: cc
  indicates the instruction sets the condition code in R15,
  and x indicates the instruction places data in R15.  A
  blank entry means the instruction does not change R15.

- The P entry indicates whether the instruction is Privileged
  (P) or not (blank)

The Args column shows the assembly language statement format.

- R is a register, e.g. R4 or R15

- D is an expression denoting the displacement, which must be
  representable in 16 bits

- k is a small constant representable in 4 bits, so 0 <= k <
  16

- K is a large constant representable in 12 bits, so 0 <=k <
  4096

The first word of an instruction:

|----+---+---+---|
| Op | D | A | B |
|    | J |   |   |
|----+---+---+---|

Fields of the first instruction word:

- Op = bits 15..12.  Used in all instructions as the primary
  operation code

- D = bits 11,10,9,8.  Destination register (e.g. R5)

- A = bits 7..4.  First operand register (e.g. R12)

- B = bits 3..0.  is either second operand register (e.g. R7)
  or secondary opcode (4-bit constant)

- k is a 4-bit constant in the d field, (e.g. 5)

- ab is 8-bit secondary opcode for EXP format (e.g. $c3)

- C is a control register specified by 4 bits

- A "don't care" field is indicated with a dash

The second word of an instruction, for RX and EXP formats:

Formats for the second word of an instruction.  The second
word may consist of one of the following:

- disp - a 16-bit constant

- kq - a 4-bit constant k (in the e field), followed by a
  12-bit constant q (in the fgh fields)

The following table summarises the instructions in the Core
subset of Sigma16.  The columns are:

- Mnemonic.  The assembly language name of the instruction

- ISA. The Instruction Set Architecture subset that contains
  the instruction; for this table all the instructions are
  Core.

- P. * indicates that the instruction is privileged, blank
  indicates that it is not.  All of the Core instructions are
  unprivileged.  For the meaning of "privileged", see the
  System section.

- Fmt. The instruction format.  There are two Core
  instruction formats: RRR (instruction has three operand
  fields, each a register) and RX (instruction has a register
  operand and an X operand consisting of a displacement
  constant and an index register).

- Args.  The assembly language argument format.  Usually this
  is the same as Fmt.  However, some instructions don't use
  all the fields, and the assembly language statement omits
  the irrelevant field (e.g. cmp is RRR format but the
  assembly language statement omits the d field, which is
  ignored).

- Code.

- Effect.  A statement in an imperative programming language
  which describes what the instruction does.

Assembly directives

- data

*** RRR format

The RRR format is used for instructions that perform calculations
in the registers, without using memory.

An instruction in RRR format is one word containing four 4-bit
fields called op, d, a, b.  Each field contains 4 bits
representing a binary number between 0 and 15.

|----+---+---+---|
| op | d | a | b |
|----+---+---+---|

# {{{svgfig(./figures/svg/RRRformat)}}}

- op (bits with index 15 to 12) is the operation code, often
  called /opcode/.  This determines the operation to be performed.
  If the opcode is between 0 and 12 it specifies an RRR
  instruction.  An opcode greater than 12 indicates an /expanding
  opcode/: the instruction is not RRR but one of the other
  formats, and it has a secondary opcode that specifies precisely
  which instruction it is.  This is explained in the sections on
  RX and EXP formats.

- d (bits 11 to 8) is the /destination register/; the register
  where (in most cases) the result will be loaded.

- a (bits 7 to 4) is the register containing the first operand.

- b (bits 3 to 0) is the register containing the second operand.

In most cases, an RRR instruction takes two operands in registers
specified by the a and b fields and produces a result which is
loaded into the register specified by the d field.

A typical example of an RRR instruction is add R4,R13,R2, which
adds the contents of registers R13 and R2, and loads the result
into R4.  It's equivalent to R4 := R13 + R2.  The opcode for add
is 0, so the machine language code for this instruction is 04d2.

Most of the RRR instructions provide the core arithmetic
operations.  The trap instruction is also RRR format.  The RRR
instructions with opcode from 8 through B all behave as nop (no
operation).  These are available for experimentation and projects.

The opcodes of D, E, F indicate that the instruction uses another
format, and is at least two words long.  D is reserved for
experimentation and projects.  E indicates EXP format, and F
indicates RX format.  For these three cases, the op field merely
indicates the instruction format, and there is a secondary
operation code that specifies which instruction it is.

*** RX format

The RX format is used for instructions that refer to a memory
address.  There are two operands: one is a register and the other
is the address of a word in memory.  Typical RX instructions are
loads, stores, and jumps.  For example, a load has an address
operand and a destination register operand; it loads the word in
memory at the specified address into the destination register.

A memory address is just a natural number.  However, the second
operand of an RX instruction, a memory address, is specified by
two pieces: an /index register/ and a natural number called the
/displacement/.  The name of the format, RX, describes briefly
these two pieces: a register (R) and an indexed memory address
(X).

The instruction consists of two consecutive words.  The first word
has the same format as an RRR instruction, with four fields: op,
d, a, b.  The second word is a single 16-bit binary number, and is
called the displacement.

- The first word contains the op, d, a, b fields:
  - The op field (bits 15-12) is 15 (hex f).  This indicates that
    the instruction has the RX format.
  - The d field (bits 11-8) is the first operand, the destination
    register.  Some RX instructions place the result into the
    destination register, but some others use d in other ways.
  - The a field (bits 7-4) is called the index register, and is
    part of the specification of the effective address.
  - The b field (bits 3-0) is the secondary opcode.  This
    specifies which RX instruction this one is (there are up to 16
    RX instructions possible).
- The second word contains one field:
  - The 16 bit displacement, often abbreviated as disp.

The value of the second operand (the memory address) is Ra + disp;
that is, the sum of the index register and the displacement.  This
sum is called the /effective address/.

In assembly language, the notation used for the effective address
is /disp[Ra]/.  For example, =3[R8]= means "3 + contents of R8".
The displacement can be written as either decimal or hex,
whichever is more convenient.  Thus $20b3[R2] means the effective
address has displacement $20b3 and the index register is R2.

When the machine executes an RX instruction, it begins by adding
the displacement and index to obtain the effective address.  This
is abbreviated "ea".

An important point is that the displacement is constant (it's a
field in the machine language instruction), but the value of the
index register can change.  So the effective address is
"constant + variable".  This fact underlies a number of essential
programming techniques.

RX instructions use an /expanding opcode/.  The op field of the
first word of the instruction contains the constant f (the
bits 1111) for every RX instruction, and the sb field is used to
hold a secondary opcode indicating which RX instruction it is.  In
effect, RX instructions require 8 bits to specify which
instruction it is (op and a).

The register operand is specified in the d field.  For
several RX instructions, this is indeed the destination of
the instruction: for example, load places data into Rd.
However, a few RX instructions use the d field differently
(see, for example, the conditional jump instructions).

An RX instruction consists of two words.  The first has the
same format as RRR.  The op field is 15, which means "this
instruction has RX format".  A secondary operation code is
needed to specify which RX instruction this is, this is given
in the b field.  The d field is the destination register, and
the a field is the index register.  There is only one operand
register for RX instructions, since the b field is needed for
the secondary operation code.

|----+---+---+---|
| op | d | a | b |
|----+---+---+---|

The second word consists of one 16-bit field called the
displacement (abbreviated as disp).

|--------------|
| displacement |
|--------------|

The index register Rb and the displacement together specify
the /effective address/.  The assembly language syntax for
the effective address is =disp[Rb]=, and its value is
$\mathrm{disp} + \mathrm{Rb}$.  For example, suppose R4
contains 7 when the following instruction is executed:

   load  R2,5[R4]
#+END_SRC

The address operand is =5[R4]=, where the displacement is 5
and the index is R4.  When the instruction executes, the
effective address is $5 + \mathrm{R4} = 5 + 7 = 12$, or
=$000c=.

The displacement is a constant given in the instruction, but
the index register is variable.  Since R0 always contains 0,
the effective address for =disp[R0]= is the value of =disp=.

The displacement is a word of bits; the machine doesn't know
whether the programmer intends the word to be a binary number, a
two's complement number, or a unicode character.  The effective
address is calculated in binary.  Thus the effective address of
=ffff[R0]= is the (positive) address of the last word in memory --
it isn't a negative number.  However, if you use the lea
instruction to put the effective address into a register, you can
do signed integer arithmetic, and =ffff= will act as -1.  You can
specify the displacement in assembly language using a negative
number, and that can often be useful.  For example, =lea
R5,-2[R0]= will put hex fffe, the two's complement representatin
of -2, into R5.


The RX instructions with opcodes from 0 through 7 are essential
Core instructions.  A few more are part of the Standard
instruction set.

Three key 32-bit instructions have RX format: xlea, xload, xstore.
Three Rx instructions, with opcodes from F,D through F,F, are

*** EXP format

The EXP instructions provide more complex operations, and they
belong to the Standard architecture.  (The Core architecture uses
only RRR and RX).  An EXP instruction consists of two words.

The first word has the same op and d fields as RRR and RX.  The op
field contains 14 (hex e), which indicates that the instruction is
EXP format.  The a and b fields are treated as one 8-bit natural
number, which is the secondary operation code.  This provides for
the possibility of up to 256 EXP format instructions, which
enables new experimental instructions to be defined.

# {{{svgfig(EXPformat)}}}

|----+---+----|
| op | d | ab |
|----+---+----|

The second word contains four 4-bit fields.  Each of these may
contain either a register number or a short 4-bit number,
depending on the instruction.

|---+---+---+---|
| e | f | g | h |
|---+---+---+---|

- e  (bits 15-12) 4-bit operand
- f  (bits 11-8)  4-bit operand
- g  (bits 7-4)   4-bit operand
- h  (bits 3-0)   4-bit operand

| 15-12 | 11-8 | 7-4 | 3-0 |

The first group of EXP instructions provide operations including
logic, bit manipulation.  These are standard instructions, but not
part of the Core, which provides only a minimal set of
instructions.

We usually write instructions in assembly language (sub
R3,R12,R9) but the computer executes machine language (13c9).
There is a precise relationship between these two notations
for an instruction.  By writing assembly language, you
determine the exact value of every bit in every word of a
machine language program.  This section explains how these
two notations for an instruction are related.

When each instruction is described below, an example is given
showing a typical use of the instruction, along with the
general form of the assembly language instruction.

The general form uses the machine language field names to
show where each piece of the instruction goes in the machine
code.  The instruction format is also given, along with any
constant fields.

As an example, the logicu instruction is EXP format, so its
machine language representation consists of two words with
the following fields:

|----+---+----+---|
| op | d | a  | b |
|----+---+----+---|
| e  | f | g  | h |
|----+---+----+---|

The primary opcode is e, which goes in the op field.  The
secondary opcode is 14, which goes in the ab field.  Thus
op=e, a=1, and b=4 (here, a dollar sign is used before the
hex constants to distinguish them from the field names).

|----+---+----+----|
| $e | d | $1 | $4 |
|----+---+----+----|
| e  | f | g  | h  |
|----+---+----+----|

and the For example, here is the general form of the logicu
instruction:

#+BEGIN_SRC Sigma16 exports: code
   logicu  Rd,e,Rf,g,h     ; Rd.e := h (Rd.e, Rf.g)
   EXP op=#e ab=$14
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC Sigma16 exports: code
   logicu  Rd,e,Rf,g,h     ; Rd.e := h (Rd.e, Rf.g)
   EXP op=#e ab=$14
#+END_SRC

The format is EXP, so the instruction has all the fields of
the EXP format: op, d, ab, e, f, g, h.  There are two
constant fields: the primary opcode (op) is =$e=, and the
secondary opcode (ab) is =$14=.  The values of the other
fields are given in the general form of the assembly
language.  The operands Rd and Rf refer to registers, and
those register numbers go into the d and f fields of the
instruction.  The e, g, and h fields are given as numbers in
the assembly language.  (The assembly language convention is
to give constants in decimal notation, not hexadecimal.)

Example:
#+BEGIN_SRC Sigma16 exports: code
   logicu  R7,5,R2,13,xor ; R7.5 := R7.5 xor R2.13
   e714 52d6
#+END_SRC

** Arithmetic

*** Addition and subtraction: add, sub
**** add

The instruction ~add Rd,Ra,Rb~ has operands ~Ra~ and ~Rb~ and
destination ~Rd~.  It fetches the operands ~Ra~ and ~Rb~,
calculates the sum ~Ra~ + ~Rb~, and loads the result into the
destination ~Rd~.  The effect is ~Rd := Ra + Rb~.  For
example, ~add R5,R12,R2~ performs ~R5 := R12 + R3~.

As well as setting the destination register, the add
instruction sets or clears the overflow and carry bits in the
condition code (which is R15).  The other bits in R15 are not
changed.

If the destination register is R15, the sum is placed in R15,
and the overflow and carry flags are discarded.

The add instruction is RRR format with opcode=0.  Given
destination Rd and operands Ra and Rb (where d, a, b are hex
digits), add Rd,Ra,Rb is reprseented by 0dab.

A field is a consecutiave sequence of bits within a word.  A
field is specified with the index of the leftmost bit in the
field, along with the size of the field.  For example, the
field in x with index 9 and size 3 consists of the bits x.9
x.8 x.7.

#+BEGIN_SRC Sigma16 exports: code
    add R1,R2,R3    ; R1 := R2 + R3
#+END_SRC

The instruction add Rd,Ra,Rb has operands Ra and Rb and
destination Rd.  It fetches the operands Ra and Rb,
calculates the sum Ra + Rb, and loads the result into the
destination Rd.  The effect is Rd := Ra + Rb.  For example,
add R5,R12,R2 performs R5 := R12 + R3.

The add instruction is RRR format with opcode=0.  Given
destination Rd and operands Ra and Rb (where d, a, b are hex
digits), add Rd,Ra,Rb is reprseented by 0dab.
  
The add instruction can be used for both binary addition (on
natural numbers) and for two's complement addition (on signed
integers).

- 16-bit natural numbers are unsigned integers 0, 1, 2,
  ..., 65535.  If two natural numbers are added, the result
  is a natural number (the result cannot be negative).  If
  the result is 65536 or larger, it cannot be represented as
  a 16 bit binary number.  If this happens, the destination
  register is set to the lower 16 bits of the true result,
  and the binary overflow flag is set in the Condition Code.
  
- 16-bit two's complement numbers are signed integers
  -32999?, ..., -1, 0, 1, ..., 32???.  If two signed integers
  are added, the result is a signed integer.  If the result
  is less than -32000 or greater than 32000, then the result
  cannot be represented as a 16 bit two's complement number.
  If this happens, the destination register is set to the
  lower 16 bits of the true result, and the two's complement
  overflow flag is set in the Condition Code.  Furthermore,
  the overflow flag is set in the req register.  If
  interrupts are enabled and the overflow flag is 1 in the
  mask register, then an interrupt will occur immediatelhy
  after the add instruction executes.

The add instruction can be used for both binary addition (on
natural numbers) and for two's complement addition (on signed
integers).

- 16-bit natural numbers are unsigned integers 0, 1, 2,
  ..., 65535.  If two natural numbers are added, the result

  the result is 65536 or larger, it cannot be represented as
  a 16 bit binary number.  If this happens, the destination
  register is set to the lower 16 bits of the true result,
  and the binary overflow flag is set in the Condition Code.
  
- 16-bit two's complement numbers are signed integers
  -32999?, ..., -1, 0, 1, ..., 32???.  If two signed integers
  are added, the result is a signed integer.  If the result
  is less than -32000 or greater than 32000, then the result
  cannot be represented as a 16 bit two's complement number.
  If this happens, the destination register is set to the

  mask register, then an interrupt will occur immediatelhy
  after the add instruction executes.

**** sub

Example: sub R1,R2,R3 ; R1 := R2 - R3

This instruction is similar to add; the only difference is
that it calculates R2-R3 and places the result in R1.  The
effect on the condition code is the same as for add.

The instruction sub Rd,Ra,Rb has operands Ra and Rb and
destination Rd.  It fetches the operands Ra and Rb,
calculates the difference Ra - Rb, and loads the result into
the destination Rd.  The effect is Rd := Ra - Rb.  For
example, sub R5,R12,R2 performs R5 := R12 - R3.

The sub instruction is RRR format with opcode=1.

*** Multiplication and division: mul, div
**** mul

Example: mul R1,R2,R3 ; R1 := R2 * R3

The multiply instruction mul Rd,Ra,Rb calculates the integer
(two's complement) product of the operands Ra and Rb, and
places the result in the destination register Rd.  The mul
instruction does not produce the natural (binary) product.

If the magnitude of the product is too large to be
representable as a 16 bit two's complement integer, this is
an overflow.  If overflow occurs, the integer overflow bit is
set in the condition code (F15) and the integer overflow bit
is also set in the interrupt request register (req), and the
lower order 16 bits of the product are loaded into Rd.

**** div

Example: div R1,R2,R3 ; R1 := R2 / R3, R15 := R2 rem R3

Unlike the other arithmetic operations, the divide
instruction div Rd,Ra,Rb produces two results: the quotient
Ra / Rb and the remainder Ra rem Rb.  It loads the quotient
into the destination register Rd, and the remainder is loaded
into R15.

#+BEGIN_EXPORT html
<div style="overflow-x: auto">
#+END_EXPORT
|--------------------+------------------------------|
| assembly language  | div Rd,Ra,Rb                 |

|--------------------+------------------------------|
#+BEGIN_EXPORT html
</div>
#+END_EXPORT

If the destination register Rd is R15, then the quotient is
placed in R15, and the remainder is discarded.

The divide instruction doesn't set the condition code, since
R15 is used for the remainder.  Therefore there is no
condition code bit to indicate division by 0.  However, it is
easy for a program to detect a division by 0.

- (Explicit test for error) The program can compare the
  divisor with 0 before or after executing the divide
  instruction, and jump to an error handler if the divisor
  is 0.  This is similar to testing the condition code after
  an add, sub, or mul instruction, but it does require two
  instructions: a compare followed by a conditional jump.
  For example:

#+BEGIN_SRC Sigma16 exports: code
   div    R1,R2,R3       ; R1 := R2/R3, R15 := R2 rem R3
   cmp    R3,R0       ; Did we divide by 0?
   jumpeq zeroDivide[R0] ; If yes, handle error
#+END_SRC
  
- (Exception) The program can detect division by 0 using an
  interrupt.  To do this, enable interrupts and enable the
  interrupt mask for division by 0.  See the section on
  Interrupts.  This approach does not require a compare or
  jump instruction for each division.

*** Comparison: cmp
**** cmp

The compare instruction =cmp Ra,Rb= compares the values in
the operand registers =Ra= and =Rb=, and then sets flags in
the condition code (R15) to indicate the result. The notation
R15.i means bit /i/ in R15; thus R15.0 is the leftmost bit of
R15.  The instruction performs both natural number comparison
(binary) and integer comparison (two's complement).  The
resulting flags are

- binary less than (L) in R15.0
- two's complement less than (<) in R15.1
- equal in R15.2
- binary greater than (G) in R15.3
- two's complement greater than (>) in R15.4

#+END_EXPORT

The result of a cmp instruction can be used to control a
conditional jump.  The jumpc0 instruction jumps is a
specified bit of R15 is 0, and the jumpc1 instruction jumps
if a specified bit is 1.

Pseudoinstructions provide the most common cases; for example
jumple jumps if the condition code indicates that a
comparison produced either integer less-than or equal.  A
common pattern is a cmp followed by a jump pseudoinstruction,
for example:

#+BEGIN_SRC Sigma16 exports: code
    cmp     R4,R9      ; compare R4 with R9
    jumpgt  abc]R0]    ; if R4 > R9 then goto abc
#+END_SRC

*** Natural numbers: addc, muln, divn
**** addc

The addc instruction performs a binary addition with carry
propagation.  It adds the two operand registers and the carry
bit in the condition code register, R15.  The sum is loaded
into the destination register Rd and the carry output is
written back into the carry bit, overwriting its previous
value.  Overflow is not possible with this instruction.

**** muln

#+BEGIN_SRC Sigma16 exports: code
     muln   Rd,Ra,Rb
#+END_SRC

The muln instruction calculates the product of two natural
numbers in Ra and Rb.  The result is 32 bits; the leftmost 16
bits (the most significant part) is loaded into R15, and the
rightmost 16 bits (the least significant part) is loaded into
Rd.  If Rd is R15, the most significant part is discarded.

- The dividend is a 32 bit natural number; its leftmost 16
  bits are in R15 and the rightmost 16 bits are in Ra.

  remainder.
- The leftmost 16 bits of the quotient are placedin R15
  (replacing the leftmost part of the dividend).  The
  rightmost16 bits of the quotient are placed in Rd.
- The remainder is placed in Ra, overwriting the least
  significant half of the dividend operand

** Accessing memory

A memory address is a 16-bit binary number.  Instructions
don't specify addresses directly; they specify an address
with two components: a *displacement* and an *index*, written
as "displacement[index]".  The displacement is a 16 bit
constant, and in assembly language it may be given as a
decimal integer, a hexadecimal word, or a label.  The index
is a register.  For example,$0c45[R5] has a displacement of
0c45 and an index of R5.

When an instruction executes, the machine takes the
displacement and index and calculates the *effective
address*.  This is defined to be the binary sum of the
displacement and the curent value in the index register.  In
the example above, if R5 contains 3, then the effective
address of $0c45[R5] is $0c48.

If you just want to specify an address *a* in an instruction,
this can be written as "a[R0]".  Since R0 contains the
constant 0, the effective address is just *a*.


*** Effective address: lea

The *load effective address* instruction *lea Rd,disp[Ra]*
calculates the effective address of the operand disp[Ra] and
places the result in the destination register Rd.  The
effective address is the binary sum disp+Ra.

disp+Rx.

Store copies the word in the destination register into memory
at the effective address.  This instruction is unusual in
that it treats the "destination register" as the source of
data, and the actual destination which is modified is the
memory location.

Most instructions take data from the rightmost operands and
modify the leftmost destination, just like an assignment
statement (x := y+z).  However, the store instruction
operates in the opposite direction.  The reason for this has
to do with the circuit design of the processor.  Although the
"left to right" nature of the store instruction may look
inconsistent from the programmer's point of view, it actually
is more consistent from the deeper perspective of circuit
design.

Examples

#+BEGIN_SRC Sigma16 exports: code
   store  R3,$2b8e[R5]
   store  R12,count[R0]
   store  R6,arrayX[R2]
#+END_SRC

*** Stacks: push, pop, top

Three instructions (push, pop, top) support operations on a
stack represented as an array of contiguous elements, where
the stack grows from lower to higher addresses.  These
instructions provide safe operations: they never overwrite
memory outside the stack, and they indicate stack underflow
and overflow by setting the condition code and optionaly
performing an exception.

A stack is represented by three addresses, which are provided
to the push, pop, and top instructions in registers:
- The /stack base/ is the address of the first word allocated
  for the stack.
- The /stack limit/ is the address of the last word allocated
  for the stack.
- The /stack top/ is the address of the stack element that
  was pushed most recently.

Although three addresses are required to characterise the
state of a stack, each individual stack instruction (push,
pop, top) requires only two of those addresses.  These are
supplied as the Ra and Rb operands, while Rd is used to
supply or receive the data value.

The maximum number of elements the stack may contain is
/stack limit/ - /stack base/ + 1.  Normally, /stack limit/ is
greater than /stack base/.  If they are equal, there is only
one word allocated for the stack (which is generally not
useful), and if /stack base/ > /stack limit/ then no memory
at all is allocated and every stack operation will signal an
underflow or overflow error.

If the stack is not empty, then /stack top/ is the address of
the top element in the stack.  If the stack is empty, then
/stack top/ must be /stack base/ - 1.

A stack can be created and initialized by allocating a region
of memory, setting /stack base/ to the first word and /stack
limit/ to the last word, and setting /stack top/ to /stack
base/ - 1.

**** push

The push instruction pushes an element onto a stack.  It is
RRR format, and its general form is:

#+BEGIN_SRC Sigma16 exports: code
      push   Rd,Ra,Rb
#+END_SRC

- Rd = /stack data/: value to be pushed, unchanged
- Ra = /stack top/: incremented unless stack was full
- Rb = /stack limit/: unchanged
- R15 condition code indicates stack overflow
- System interrupt request register indicates stack overflow

This instruction pushes the word in Rd onto a stack with
/stack top/ in Rd and /stack limit/ in Rb, provided that the
stack is not full.  The push stores the data word in Ra into
memory and increments /stack top/ Rd.  If the stack is full,
nothing is stored into memory and a stack overflow error is
indicated in the condition code and interrupt request
registers; an interrupt will occur if interrupts are enabled
and the stack mask bit is set.  The operational semantics is:
 
#+BEGIN_SRC Sigma16 exports: code
if Ra < Rb
  then Ra := Ra + 1; mem[Ra] := Rd
  else R15.sovfl := 1, req.sovfl := 1
#+END_SRC
  
If Rd = Rb this means the stack completely fills the region
of memory allocated for the stack, and there is no space to
store a new element.  In this case, the push instruction does
not store Ra, it doesn't modify Rd, it doesn't modify memory
outside the block, and it doesn't overwrite data in the
stack.  Instead, the instruction indicates a stack overflow
by setting the sovfl (stack overflow) bit in the condition
code (R15), and it also sets the stack fault bit in the
interrupt request register.  If interrupts are enabled and
the stack fault bit is set in the interrupt mask register,
then an interrupt will occur after the push instruction
completes.  There will be no interrupt if interrupts are
disabled, or the stack fault bit is not set in the mask
register.

**** pop

The push instruction removes an element onto a stack and
returns it.  The instruction is RRR format, and its general
form is:

#+BEGIN_SRC Sigma16 exports: code
      pop    Rd,Ra,Rb
#+END_SRC

- Rd = /stack data/: destination for the popped stack element
- Ra = /stack top/: decremented unless stack was empty
- Rb = /stack base/: unchanged
- R15 condition code indicates stack underflow
- System interrupt request register indicates stack underflow

This instruction pops the word from a stack with /stack top/
in Ra and /stack base/ in Rb, provided that the stack is not
empty.  The pop loads the top element of the stack into Rd
and decrements /stack top/.  If the stack is empty, /stack
top/ is not decremented, Rd is not modified, and a stack
underflow error is indicated in the condition code and
interrupt request registers; an interrupt will occur if
interrupts are enabled and the stack mask bit is set.  The
operational semantics is:

#+BEGIN_SRC Sigma16 exports: code
if Ra >= Rb
  then Rd := mem[Ra]; Ra := Ra - 1
  else R15.suvfl := 1, req.suvfl := 1
#+END_SRC

**** top

The top instruction returns the top element on a stack but
does not remove it.  The instruction is RRR format, and its
general form is:

#+BEGIN_SRC Sigma16 exports: code
      top    Rd,Ra,Rb
#+END_SRC

- Rd = /stack data/: destination for the top element of the
  stack; unchanged if stack is empty
- Ra = /stack top/: unchanged
- Rb = /stack base/: unchanged
- R15 condition code indicates stack underflow
- System interrupt request register indicates stack underflow

This instruction loads the element at /stack top/ into Rd,
provided that the stack is not empty.  If the stack is empty,
Rd is not modified and a stack underflow error is indicated
in the condition code and interrupt request registers; an
interrupt will occur if interrupts are enabled and the stack
mask bit is set.  The operational semantics is:

#+BEGIN_SRC Sigma16 exports: code
if Ra >= Rb
  then Rd := mem[Ra]
  else R15.suvfl := 1, req.suvfl := 1
#+END_SRC

*** Stack frames: save, restore

When a program calls a procedure it is usually necessary to
save the state of the caller in a data structure called a
stack frame.  (This is not necessary during a "tail call".)
The stack frame is pushed onto the execution stack.  When the
procedure returns, the contents of the stack frame need to be
loaded back into the registers.  These operations can be
performed by ordinary store instructions (for procedure call)
and load instructions (for procedure return).  However, this
often requires a significant number of instructions.

The =save= and =restore= instructions transfer a block of
data between registers and memory, making it easier to use
stack frames.  These instructions are analogous to =store=
and =load=, but they store or load multiple words, not just
an individual word.

- *save* stores a sequence of adjacent registers into a block
  of contiguous memory locations.
- *restore* is the opposite: it loads the block of memory
  into the registers.

For both instructions, the sequence of registers is specified
by giving the first and last register.  The starting address
of the memory block is specified by an effective address of
the form =offset[Reg]=, where Reg is any register (e.g. R4,
R13, etc) and =offset= is a number between 0 and 255.

Normally $d \leq e$, in which case the number of registers to
be saved is $e-d + 1$.  If $d > e$, the instruction will do
nothing.  The base register $R_f$ should not lie within the
group of registers to be saved or restored.

The first register to be saved is $R_d$, and the last
register to be saved is $R_e$.  The instruction always stores
at least one register.  If $d = e$, for example =save
R5,R5,0[R14]= then only R5 is stored.  If $d < e$ then the
register numbers wrap around For example,

There is an important restriction with =save= and =restore=:
the displacement is limited to a small natural number between
0 and 255.  (Recall that for load and store, the displacement
can be as large as 65,535.)  The reason for this is that the
save and restore instructions are EXP format and the offset
is represented by an 8-bit field (whereas load and store are
RX format and the displacement is a 16-bit word).

The instruction is EXP format, and the offset is limited to 8
bits, because it is specified in the *gh* field, which is the
rightmost 8 bits of the second word of the instruction.  The
secondary opcode is 9, which is in the ab field of the first
word of the instruction.

**** save

The save instruction performs a sequence of stores, which
copy the contents of a sequence of registers into consecutive
memory locations.  It is useful for saving registers on a
procedure call or interrupt, as well as storing a record from
registers into memory.

For example, the following instruction will save registers R3
through R9 into memory starting at address 6 + R13.  Its
machine language code is e30b 9d06.

#+BEGIN_SRC Sigma16 exports: code
    save   R3,R9,6[R13]
#+END_SRC

This instruction is equivalent to a sequence of store
instructions:

#+BEGIN_SRC Sigma16 exports: code
    store   R3,6[R13]
    store   R4,7[R13]
    store   R5,8[R13]
    store   R6,9[R13]
    store   R7,10[R13]
    store   R8,11[R13]
    store   R9,12[R13]
#+END_SRC

Using =save= and =restore= can make procedure calls more
concise and readable.  Even more importantly, they are less
error prone: it's easy to make a typo in sequences of store
instructions as in the example.

**** restore

This =restore= instruction has the same operands as =save=,
and it performs a sequence of loads corresponding to the
stores performed by save.

For example, consider this instruction:

#+BEGIN_SRC Sigma16 exports: code
   restore  R3,R10,4[R14]
#+END_SRC

The effect is equivalent to

#+BEGIN_SRC Sigma16 exports: code
   load  R3,4[R14]
   load  R4,5[R14]
   load  R5,6[R14]
   load  R6,7[R14]

   load  R8,9[R14]
   load  R9,10[R14]
   load  R10,11[R14]
#+END_SRC

Suppose a stack frame was created by the =save= example
above.  To restore the registers from the stack frame, use:
  
#+BEGIN_SRC Sigma16 exports: code
   restore R3,R9,6[R13]  ; e30b 9d06. store R3-R9 starting at 6[R13]
#+END_SRC

It is equivalent to a sequence of store instructions:

#+BEGIN_SRC Sigma16 exports: code
   load   R3,6[R13]
   load   R4,7[R13]
   load   R5,8[R13]
   load   R6,9[R13]
   load   R7,10[R13]
   load   R8,11[R13]
   load   R9,12[R13]
#+END_SRC
  
#+BEGIN_SRC Sigma16 exports: code
   restore R3,R5,6[R13]  ; e30c 5d06. load R3-R5 starting at 6[R13]
#+END_SRC

This is equivalent to a sequence of load instructions:
#+BEGIN_SRC Sigma16 exports: code
   load    R3,6[R13]
   load    R4,7[R13]
   load    R5,8[R13]
   load    R6,9[R13]
#+END_SRC

The *restore* instruction copies a sequence of consecutive
memory locations starting from the effecive address into a
sequence of adjacent registers.  The index register (R14 in
this example) is not changed.  Restore is equivalent to a
fixed sequence of load instructions; its purpose of restore
is to restore the state of registers from memory after a
procedure call or a context switch.

The instruction *restore Re,Rf,gh[Rd]* copies the contents of
memory at consecutive locations beginning with mem[gh+Rf]
into registers Re, Re+1, ..., Rf.

** Control flow
*** Jumps

A jump is a transfer control to another address, rather than
to the following instruction. The destination address is
specified as the effective address in the jump instruction.
A jump can be used to implement a goto statement.

**** jumpc0, jumpc1

These instructions jump to a destination if a specified bit
in the condition code is 0 (for jumpc0) or 1 (for jumpc1).

The first operand of jumpc0 is the index of a bit in R15.
Don't specify R15; the condition bit is always in R15.  The
index of the condition bit must be specified in the d field
of the instruction.  Since this is an index, not a register,
it's written as a number.

- jumpc0 3,loop[R0]  ; Right
- jumpc0 R3,loop[R0] ; Wrong - not using R3!

#+BEGIN_SRC Sigma16 exports: code

*** Branches (???)

A branch instruction transfers control to another address,
rather than to the following instruction. The destination
address is specified as an offset relative to the value of
the pc (after the pc has been incremented).  A branch can be
used to implement a goto statement.  (See also [[*Jumps][Jumps]].)

The operand is a 16-bit natural number called the /offset/.
This is added to (brf) or subtracted from (brb) the current
value of the pc register.  Since the pc is incremented as the
instruction is fetched, an offset of 0 refers to the
instruction after the brf/brb.

#+BEGIN_SRC Sigma16 exports: code
a    brf  3
     add  R0,R0,R0  ; brf 0 would go here
     add  R0,R0,R0  ; brf 1 would go here
     add  R0,R0,R0  ; brf 2 would go here
b    add  R0,R0,R0  ; the instruction a actually goes here
#+END_SRC

Normally the operand is expressed as a label rather than a
constant.

#+BEGIN_SRC Sigma16 exports: code
a    brf  b
     add  R0,R0,R0
     add  R0,R0,R0
     add  R0,R0,R0
b    add  R0,R0,R0  ; the instruction a goes here
#+END_SRC

If the operand is expressed as a number (brf 3), the
assembler uses the number in the machine instruction.
However, if the operand is expressed as a lable (brf b), the
assembler calculates the correct offset value and inserts
that into the machine instruction.

In order to implement /goto xyz/, use =brf xyz= (branch
forward) if =xyz= occurs after the branch instruction, and
use =brb xyz= (branch backward) if =xyz= occurs before the
branch.

**** brc0, brfc1

There are two conditional branch instructions that perform a
branch based on the value of a bit in a register.  For
example, brc0 R7,3,xyz means "if bit 3 of R7 is 0 then go to
xyz".

These instructions are somewhat similar to jumpc0 and jumpc1,

- The branch instructions can use any bit in any register of
  the register file to determine whether the branch will take
  place, but the jump instructions can use only a bit in the
  condition code R15.
- The branch instructions are pc-relative, but the jump
  instructions give the absolute address of the destination.

**** brz, brnz

These instructions perform a branch if a specified register
is either equal to 0 (z), or not equal to 0 (nz).  Equal to 0
means every bit in the register is 0; not equal to 0 means
some bit in the register is 1.

**** dispatch

The /dispatch/ instruction implements a branch table.  It
provides an efficient way to implement a case statement using
a binary code.

Suppose =code= is a variable that contains an integer, such
that $0 \leq code < 8$.  The following set of instructions
will branch to a specific destination depending on the value
of the code.

#+BEGIN_SRC Sigma16 exports: code
   dispatch R8,3,0       ; 38 dispatch 3-bit code
   brf    caseA        ; if code=0 then goto caseA
   brf    caseB        ; if code=1 then goto caseB
   brf    caseC        ; if code=2 then goto caseC
   brf    caseD        ; if code=3 then goto caseD
   brf    caseE        ; if code=4 then goto caseE
   brf    caseF        ; if code=5 then goto caseF
   brf    caseG        ; if code=6 then goto caseG
   brf    caseH        ; if code=7 then goto caseH
#+END_SRC

The =dispatch= instruction has three operands: a register
/code/ that specifies a binary code, an integer constant
/size/ that gives the number of bits in the code, and a fixed
/offset/ (which is usually 0).

- The instruction automatically uses /size/ to mask the code,
  by performing a logical and.  For example, if /size/ is 3,
  it calculates /code/ AND fff7.  This ensures that the
  resulting code is not out of range: it is guaranteed to lie
  between 0 and $2 ^ size - 1$.
- The instruction then performs a pc relative branch forward
  by a distance of 2 * code + offset.  The multiplication by
  2 ensures that a 2-word instruction can be placed in each
  position in the branch table.
- The branch table is normally a sequence of unconditional
  branch instructions, either brf or brb.

*** Logic

Sigma16 provides two logic instructions that can evaluate
arbitrary Boolean expressions.  They implement all possible
logic functions, not just the most common ones.  You can
perform logic on individual bits, on a field within words, or
on all the bits in a word.

- =logicf= performs bitwise logic on corresponding fields
  within two operand registers; the result overwrites the
  field in the first operand.
- =logicb= performs logic on two operand bits that may be at
  arbitrary indices within arbitrary registers.  The result
  overwrites the first operand bit.

The assembly language provides a group of pseudoinstructions
for the most common operations. Some of these (invw, andw,
orw, xorw) are introduced in the tutorial section on logic.
It is often more convenient and readable to use the
pseudoinstructions, rather than the general =logicf= and
=logicb=.

When translating a high level language program into assembly
language, there are two ways to implement a Boolean
expression: using logic instructions, or using a sequence of
conditional jumps ("short circuit evaluation").  It's good
practice to understand both methods and to use whichever is
more appropriate in a specific situation.  Just because an
AND or OR operator appears in a program, that doesn't
necessarily mean that a logic instruction should be used.
The logic instructions are important, and have many
applications in practical programming, but it is sometimes
better to use "short circuit evaluation" instead.

The next section explains how logic functions are
represented, and the following sections describe each logic
instruction followed by its pseudoinstructions.

**** General logic functions

The commonest Boolean operators are =inv=, =and2=, =or2=, and
=xor2=.  The =inv= function (also called invert, not, logical
negation) has one input and produces one output, as defined
by the truth table:

| x | inv x |
|---+-------|
| 0 |     1 |
| 1 |     0 |

The =and2=, =or2=, =xor2= functions have two inputs, so their
truth tables have four lines.  There are also functions with
more inputs, such as =and3= with 3 inputs, =and4= with 4
inputs, and so on.  Sigma16 doesn't have instructions for
those, but you can replace them with multiple uses of =and2=,
=or2=, etc.

These aren't the only useful operations: there are 16 logic
functions that take two arguments.  Instead of providing
specialised instructions for a few of the logic functions,
Sigma16 provides general instructions that implement all of
them.

Every logic function with two inputs $x$ and $y$ can be
defined by a truth table where we list all possible values
for the inputs and give the corresponding result.  Each input
could be either 0 or 1.  Since there are 2 inputs, there are
$2^2 = 4$ lines in the truth table.

The tables above for and2, or2, xor2 give specific values,
either 0 or 1, for each result.  For example, the result
column for the =and2= function is (reading from top to
bottom) 0001, while =xor2= is 0110.  For an arbitrary
function, we can write the result column as $abcd$ where each
variable is either 0 or 1.

| x | y | result |
|---+---+--------|
| 0 | 0 | a      |
| 0 | 1 | b      |
| 1 | 0 | c      |
| 1 | 1 | d      |

If $(a,b,c,d) = (0,0,0,1)$ this is the truth table for
=and2=.  if $(a,b,c,d) = (0,1,1,0)$ it is the truth table for
=xor2=.  Since there are 4 variables, there are $2^4=16$
possible settings of $(a,b,c,d)$ and consequently there are
16 Boolean logic functions that take two arguments.

The Sigma16 logic instructions provide all 16 of these
functions; taking a 4-bit code that specifies the logic
function by giving the values of $(a,b,c,d)$.  In assembly
language, the code is given as the decimal number represented
by the bits $(a,b,c,d)$, which is between 0 and 15.  The
codes for a few of the functions are:

| abcd | code | name      |
|------+------+-----------|
| 0001 |    1 | x and2 y  |
| 0111 |    7 | x or2 y   |
| 0110 |    6 | x xor2 y  |
| 1110 |   14 | x nand2 y |
| 1000 |    8 | x nor2 y  |

The =inv= function can be treated as a 2-input function where
the second argument is ignored.

Instead of writing the numeric code, we can define symbolic
names for the logic functions we need:

#+BEGIN_SRC Sigma16 exports: code
and  equ     1
or   equ     7
xor  equ     6
#+END_SRC

Now, instead of specifying a logic function as (for example)
6, we can write it as =xor=.

**** Logic on fields: logicf

The logicf instruction performs a bitwise logic operation on
fields within two words.  The fields may be in different
registers, but each field must be at the same position: their
start and end indices must be the same.  Each bit of the
result is obtained by performing a specified logic function
on the corresponding bits of the two fields.  The result
overwrites the field in the first operand register. The
function $h$ is specified as described above; for example, 6
is the code for exclusive or.

The field is specified as a pair of 4-bit constants f, g,
where f is the index of the rightmost bit in the field and g
is the index of the leftmost bit.  Since the rightmost bit
has a lower index, g should be greater than f.  If $f=g$ then
the field consists of just one bit.  If $g<f$ then the field
is empty, and the instruction will not change the destination
register.  The notation Rd.f:g means bits f through g in
register Rd.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
;    logicf  Rd,Re,f,g,h
;      Rd = first operand register and destination register
;      Re = second operand register
;      f = index of rightmost bit in field (in both registers))
;      g = index of leftmost bit in field (in both registers)
;      h = logic function
;      effect:  Rd.f:g := map2 h (Rd.f:g, Re.f:g)
;      format: EXP
;      machine language: Ed00 efgh (op=$E, ab=$00)
     logicf  R3,R9,5,8,xor   ; e300 9586
#+END_EXAMPLE

The following examples use the definitions of and, or, xor
given above.

#+BEGIN_SRC Sigma16 exports: code
     lea     R1,$3333[R0]   ; R1 := 3333
     lea     R2,$5555[R0]   ; R2 := 5555
     logicf  R1,R2,0,3,and  ; R1 := 3331
     logicf  R1,R2,4,7,or   ; R1 := 3371
     logicf  R1,R2,8,11,xor ; R1 := 3671
#+END_SRC

**** Word logic pseudoinstructions: invw, andw, orw, xorw

Several special cases of =logicf= appear frequently.  There
are special pseudoinstructions that simplify these special
cases by allowing some of the operands to be omitted.

The first simplification is to omit the operand that
specifies the logic function, and instead to indicate the
function in the mnemonic.  For example, suppose you want to
calculate the logical /and/ of two fields.  This can be done
with the general logicf instruction:

#+BEGIN_example
     logicf Rd,Re,f,g,1
#+END_example

Alternatively, you can indicate the logic function in the
mnemonic and omit the function operand:

#+BEGIN_example
     andf Rd,Re,f,g
#+END_example

This simplification can be used with the following four
functions (the comment shows the actual machine instruction
generated by the assembler):

#+BEGIN_example
;    invf   Rd,f,g        ; logicf Rd,R0,f,g,12
;    andf   Rd,Re,f,g     ; logicf Rd,Re,f,g,1
;    orf    Rd,Re,f,g     ; logicf Rd,Re,f,g,2
;    xorf   Rd,Re,f,g     ; logicf Rd,Re,f,g,6
#+END_example

The second simplification is to perform logic on an entire
word, rather than a field within the word.  This is achieved
by specifying $f=0$ and $g=15$.  The instruction =logicf
Rd,Re,0,15,h= applies h bitwise to the entire regisers Rd and
Re, and the result overwrites Rd.  There are
pseudoinstructions to simplify this (which were introduced in
a tutorial section above):

#+BEGIN_SRC Sigma16 exports: code
    invw  R3      ; R3 := invert R3
    andw  R3,R4   ; R3 := R3 and R4
    orw   R3,R4   ; R3 := R3 or R4
    xorw  R3,R4   ; R3 := R3 xor R4
#+END_SRC

A pseudoinstruction is not a machine instruction: the Sigma16
processor does not have an =andw= instruction.  Instead, the
assembler generates the =logicf= instruction corresponding to
any of =invw=, =andw=, =orw=, =xorw=.  The following assembly
language statements generate exactly the same machine
language:

#+BEGIN_SRC Sigma16 exports: code
     andw    R5,R7          ; R5 := R5 and R7
     logicf  R5,R7,0,15,1   ; R5 := R5 and R7
#+END_SRC

If you're using one of the most common logic functions, a
pseudoinstruction is convenient and can make a program more
readable.  If you prefer to use the actual machine
instruction, rather than a pseudoinstruction, you can define
a symbol for the logic function using an =equ= assembly
directive.  The symbol can then be used instead of the
numeric code:

#+BEGIN_SRC Sigma16 exports: code
xor  equ   6
     ...
     logicf R5,R7,R2,xor   ; R5 := R7 xor R2
#+END_SRC

**** Bit logic: logicb

The bit logic instruction =logicb= specifies two operand
bits, which may be in any register at any index.  It applies
a specified logic function to these bits and puts the result
bit back into the first operand, overwriting the previous
value of that bit.  The other bits in the first operand
register remain unchanged.  As this instruction modifies only
one bit in the first operand, it enables you to keep many
Boolean variables in just one register.

The general form is:

#+BEGIN_example
;    logicb  Rd,Re,f,g,h
;      effect: Rd.f := h (Rd.f, Re.g)
;      format: EXP
;      machine language: Ed01 efgh (op=E ab=01)
     logicb  R7,R9,3,5,6    ; e701 9356
#+END_example

Suppose you want to calculate the logical xor of the bit in
R3 at index 12 and the bit in R7 at index 14.  This
instruction will do it (provided that the symbol xor is
defined to be 6), The result will overwrite the bit in R3 at
index 12:

#+BEGIN_SRC Sigma16 exports: code
     logicb  R3,R7,12,14,xor  ; R3.12 := R3.12 xor R7.14
#+END_SRC

Example:

#+BEGIN_SRC Sigma16 exports: code
   lea    R2,$0f00[R0]   ; R2.9 := 1
   lea    R7,$2000[R0]   ; R7.13 := 1
   logicb R2,R7,9,13,xor ; R2 := 0b00 (R2.9 := R2.9 xor R7.13 = 0)
#+END_SRC

**** Pseudoinstructions: bit logic invb, andb, orb, xorb

There are pseudoinstructions for the commonest logic
functions:

#+BEGIN_SRC Sigma16 exports: code
      invb    R1,3,R2,9   ; R1.3 := inv R2.9
      andb    R1,3,R2,9   ; R1.3 := R1.3 and R2.9
      orb     R1,3,R2,9   ; R1.3 := R1.3 or R2.9
      xorb    R1,3,R2,9   ; R1.3 := R1.3 xor R2.9
#+END_SRC

The =logicf= instruction and its pseudoinstructions (=andf=, etc.) can
operate on fields of any size, including 1-bit fields.  However,
=logicb= and its pseudoinstructions are more flexible than =logicf= on
a 1-bit field, because =logicb= allows the operands to have different
bit indices.

** Bit manipulation
*** Shifting: shiftl, shiftr

The shift instructions treat the operand as a string of bits,
and move each bit a fixed distance to the left or right.

The instruction shiftl =Rd,Re,h= shifts the value in the
operand register Ra by h bits to the left, and the result is
placed in the destination register Rd.  The operand Re is not
modified.  The leftmost h bits of the operand are discarded
and the rightmost h bits of the result become 0.  The general
form is

#+BEGIN_example
;    shiftl Rd,Re,h
;      effect:  Rd := Re shl h
;      Rd = first operand register and destination register
;      Re = second operand register
;      f = unused
;      g = unused
;      h = constant shift distance
;      format: EXP/RRk
;      machine language: Ed04 efgh (op=$E, ab=$03)
     lea    R1,2[R0]   ;           R2 = 0002  0000 0000 0000 0010
     shiftl R5,R1,4    ; E503 1004 R5 = 0020  0000 0000 0010 0000
#+END_example

The instruction =shiftr Rd,Re,h= shifts the value in the
operand register Re by h bits to the right, and the result is
placed in the destination register Rd.  The operand Re is not
modified.  During the shift, the rightmost k bits of the
value are discarded and the leftmost k bits become 0.  The
general form is

#+BEGIN_example
;    shiftr Rd,Re,h
;      effect:  Rd := Re shr h
;      Rd = first operand register and destination register
;      Re = second operand register
;      f = unused
;      g = unused
;      h = constant shift distance
;      format: EXP/RRk
;      machine language: Ed04 efgh (op=$E, ab=$04)
#+END_example

The following instruction shifts the value in R3 to the right
by 5 bits and place the result in R2.  The operand register
R3 is not changed.

#+BEGIN_SRC Sigma16 exports: code
   shiftr  R2,R3,5
#+END_SRC

*** Bit fields: extract

The extract instruction copies a field within a register to
another register.  The extract instruction copies an
arbitrary field of bits from a source register and inserts
them into an arbitrary position in a destination
register. The destination field is overwritten, while other
bits in the destination register as well as all bits in the
source register are unchanged.

These instructions are useful for systems programming.
Emulators need to access instruction fields, software
implementing floating point needs to access the parts of a
floating point number, and networking software needs to
decode message headers.

*Bit indexing.* Sigma16 indexes bit positions in a word from
right to left, starting from 0.  The least significant
(rightmost) bit has index 0, and the most significant
(leftmost) bit has index 15.

A bit field is a sequence of bits within a word.  A field is
specified using a pair of 4-bit natural numbers $L,R$, where
$L$ is the index of the leftmost bit in the field and $R$ is
the index of the rightmost bit.  The size of a field is $\max
(0, L-R+1)$. Consequently, if $L < R$ the size is 0. For
example:

- R8.6,4 is the field consisting of R8.6, R8.5, R8.4 and its
  size is 3.
- R8.11,11 is the field consisting of R8.11 and its size
  is 1.
- R8.15,0 is the field containing the entire contents of R8
  and its size is 16.
- R8.5,7 is an empty field containing no bits; its size is 0

*Machine language.* The machine language format of extract is
EXP, with the following fields:

|----+---+---+---|
| op | d | a | b |
|----+---+---+---|
| e  | f | g | h |
|----+---+---+---|

- op  = $e (escape to EXP)
- Rd  = destination register
- ab  = secondary opcode: $05 for extract
- Re  = source register
- f   = destination start index L
- g   = destination end index R
- h   = source start index L

The instruction specifies the destination field as $f,g$.
The field size S and the R index for the source are not
specified in the instruction: only the leftmost index of the
source field is specified explicitly as $h$.

The sizes of the source and destination fields must be the
same.  The size and right index of the source are calculated
as follows.  The calculations verify that both the source and
destination fields have the same size.

- The size $S$ of a field specified by $L,R$ is $\max (0,
  L-R+1)$.
- In general, $R = L - S + 1$.
- Destination field = Rd.f, Rd.f-1, ..., Rd.g.
- Check that this works for destination: R = L - S + 1 = f -
  (f-g+1) + 1 = f - f + g - 1 + 1 = g.
- Source field = Re.h, Re.h-1, ..., Re.h-f+g
- Calculate $R$ for source, which is not specified in the
  instruction.  R = L - S + 1 = h - (f-g+1) + 1 = h - f + g -
  1 + 1 = h - f + g.

*Assembly language.* The assembly language operand format for
extract is RkkRk, where R denotes a register number and k
denotes a 4-bit constant.  The general form of the
instruction, in assembly language, is

#+BEGIN_SRC Sigma16 exports: code
   extract Rd,f,g,Re,h
#+END_SRC
  
*Effect.* The effect is to overwrite each bit in the
destination field with the corresponding bit in the source
field:

#+BEGIN_SRC Sigma16 exports: code
Rd.f := Re.h
Rd.f-1 := Re.h-1
...
Rd.g := Re.h-f+g
#+END_SRC

For example, consider =extract R14,9,7,R13,5=, where $f=9$,
$g=7$, $h=5$.  The field size is $f-g+1 = 9-7+1 = 3$, so 3
bit assignments take place.  The index of the rightmost bit
in the source field = $h-f+g = 5 -9 + 7 = 3$.  Therefore the
instruction performs the following bit assignments:

#+BEGIN_SRC Sigma16 exports: code
R14.9 := R13.5
R14.8 := R13.4
R14.7 := R13.3
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC Sigma16 exports: code
; Assembly language: extract Rd,f,g,Re,h
; Effect:            Rd.f..g := Re.h..(h+g-f)
; EXP opcode:        e,15

; Example:           extract R2,11,8,R1,3
; Machine language:  e215 1b83
#+END_SRC

Example:

#+BEGIN_SRC Sigma16 exports: code
extract R2,7,4,R3,20
R2.7 := R3.20
R2.6 := R3.19
R2.5 := R3.18
R2.4 := R3.17
#+END_SRC

The extract instruction can be implemented using a
combination of logic and shift instructions. It is included
in the architecture for several reasons:

- extract provides useful abstractions for writing
  interpreters and simulators.
- When used in an interpreter, bit field operations are
  executed frequently: they are a crucial part of the "inner
  loop".  Therefore the efficiency of common bit field
  operations is important.
- The bit field instructions are easier to use and more
  readable than the corresponding logic and shifts.
- This instruction can be implemented efficiently in a digital
  circuit and this implementation is an interesting design problem.

The effect of an extract instruction can be described by
writing each bit assignment individually, so there are /size/
individual bit assignments.  The notation R2.7 means /the bit
at position 7 in register R2/.  Using this notation, the
example above performs the following bit assignments:

| extract R2,R1,11,3,4 |
|----------------------|
| R2.11 := R1.3        |
| R2.10 := R1.2        |
| R2.9 := R1.1         |
| R2.8 := R1.0         |
|----------------------|

*Relation to other instructions.* Although extract performs a
number of bit assignments, it is a single instruction and its
execution time is a small fixed number of clock cycles.  The
execution time does not depend on the value of the field
size, and extracting a large field doesn't require more time
than extracting a small field. The hardware implementation of
the instruction does not use an iteration to copy the bits;
they are all copied in parallel in one clock cycle.

Any register may be specified for the source and destination.
If they are the same, the effect is to move a bit field from
one place to another within the register (this is not the
same as a shift).  If the destination is R0, the result is
discarded and the instruction has no effect.

These instructions can be implemented using a combination of
logic and shift instructions.  They are included in the
architecture for several reasons:

- These operations provide useful abstractions for writing
  interpreters and simulators.
- When used in an interpreter, bit field operations are
  executed frequently: they are a crucial part of the "inner
  loop".  Therefore the efficiency of common bit field
  operations is important.
- The bit field instructions are easier to use and more
  readable than the corresponding logic and shifts.
- These instructions can be implemented efficiently in a
  digital circuit and this implementation is an interesting
  design problem.

# Note on expressability. start-end can give 15-0 (all) or
# 5-5 (one bit) or 4-5 (nothing) start-size, size can be from
# 0 to 15 but can't make the field contain all the bits.  So
# it's slightly more expressive to use start-end rather than
# start-size.

# The size is a 4-bit field, and its value is between 0
# and 15.  Thus an extract instruction cannot copy the entire
# word in one regsiter to another register, as a size of 16
# cannot be specified.  If size=0 then the instruction does
# nothing.  the source and destination fields cannot extend
# beyond the rightmost bit in a register.

*** Pseudoinstructions: bit manipulation setb, clearb, copyb, copybi

The bit logic instructions have some useful special cases that don't
appear to involve logic at all.  These are supported by
pseudoinstructions.

- =setb Rd,f= puts 1 into a specified bit: =Rd.f := 1=.
- =clearb Rd,f= puts 0 into the specified bit.
- =copyb Rd,Re,f,g= copies a bit from register Re at index g
  into register Rd at index f.
- =copybi Rd,Re,f,g= is similar to copyb, except that it
  inverts the bit as it is written into the destination.

Here are some examples:  

#+BEGIN_SRC Sigma16 exports: code
    setb   R4,7         ; R4.7 := 1
    clearb R4,7         ; R4.7 := 0
    copyb  R4,R12,7,5   ; R4.7 := R12.5
    copybi R4,R12,7,5   ; R4.7 := inv R12.5

programming, although they are implemented using more general
machine instructions.  For example, andw performs a bitwise
logical and2 on two registers, but this is not a machine
instruction; the assembler converts it into the corresponding
logicf instruction.

* Assembly language
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: sec-assembly-language
:END:

A computer is a digital circuit that executes programs in
machine language, which is hard for humans to read because it
consists entirely of numbers.  Assembly language provides a
readable notation for writing machine language programs.  It
uses names for instructions and variables, as well as other
notations to make the code easier to understand.

An instruction in machine language is just one or more words
(often written in hexadecimal notation), while the
corresponding instruction in assembly language uses mnemonic
names so the programmer doesn't have to memorise all the
operation codes, addresses of variables, and so on. For
example, the assembly language statement mul R12,R3,R8 is
more readable than the corresponding machine language
instruction 2c38.  However, the assembly language still gives
the programmer complete control over every bit a program.
  
A programmer writes a machine-level program in assembly
language.  A software application called the *assembler*
reads it in and translates it to machine language.  When it
sees an instruction mnemonic like add or div, it replaces it
with the operation code (0, 3, or whatever).  The assembler
helps with variable names --- the machine language needs
addresses (numbers) and the assembler calculates them
  
- You can use names (add, div) rather than numeric codes
  (0, 3)
- You can use variable names (x, y, sum) rather than memory
  addresses (02c3, 18d2)
- You write a program in assemply language
- The assembler translates it into machine language

Compilers and assemblers are similar in some ways: both of
them translate a program from one language to another.  The
main difference is that compilers translate between languages
that are quite different, while assemblers translate between
similar languages.

Example: a sequence of RRR instructions

Assembly language

#+BEGIN_SRC Sigma16 exports: code
    add    R3,R5,R1
    sub    R4,R2,R3
    mul    R1,R9,R10   
#+END_SRC

Machine language
#+BEGIN_SRC Sigma16 exports: code

#+END_SRC

** Programs, modules, and files

Sigma16 has the flexibility required for "programming in the
large".  It provides modules, separate assembly, import and
export, relocation, linking, executables, and booting.  It
also has special conventions that enable the user to skip
those complications, and simply enter a standalone program,
assemble it, and run it.  The system is straightforward for
beginners but allows a transition to realistic systems
programming.

The assembler inputs a program in assembly language.  This is
called the /source module/.  The assembler outputs an /object
module/ that contains the machine language code.  The
assembler also produces an /assembly listing/, which presents
the program in a form useful for the programmer.  The
assembly listing shows the source code, the corresponding
machine language, a symbol table, and any error messages.
Finally, the assembler outputs a /metadata module/ that
enables the emulator to track the source statement
corresponding to each instruction.

A simple program consists of just one source module that does
not import anything.  This is a /standalone program/, and
assembling it produces an /executable program/.  An
executable program is an object module that does not require
linking; it can be booted directly in the processor.

A larger program may consist of several source modules,
including one main program.  This requires use of the
/linker/ to combine the collection of object modules into a
single executable program.

*** Standalone programs

If a program consists of just one source module that does not
import any names, it is /standalone/.  There are several ways
to input a standalone program: you can choose it from one of
the examples, load it from a file, or type it into the
editor.  In all cases, the text of the program is shown in
the editor pane.  Go to the Assembler pane and click
Assemble.  If there are no errors, go directly to the
Processor pane (you can skip the Linker) and click Boot.
This will read the machine language into the memory, and now
you can run the program.

*** Modules

Large programs are easier to develop if you break them into
separate modules which can be assembled separately.  One of
the modules is identified as the /main module/, and it
imports the other modules.  This allows you to define
procedures, global variables, and symbolic constants in
separate modules.  Many separate programs can reuse these
modules simply by importing them.

The Sigma16 app maintains a /Module Set/ describing all the
modules that it knows about.  The usual workflow is to read
in all the modules comprising a program, and to assemble each
of them.  Then the linker combines all the modules in the
Module Set to form an executable.  The executable can be
saved to a file, or it can be booted into the processor.

The Module Set is displayed in the /Modules/ page.  Key
information about each module is shown, including the first
few lines of the source code.  It is good practice to begin
every source module with two or three lines of comments that
identify the code, giving its name, purpose, author, and
date.

The app maintains several invariants:

- At all times, there is at least one module.  If you close
  the last remaining module, a new one with empty source code
  is immediately created, to ensure that there is at least
  one module.

- At all times, exactly one module is /selected/.  The
  assembler always works on the selected module. When you go
  to the Assemble page, the assembler source code is set to
  the text of the selected module.

- At all times, the source code text of the selected module
  is displayed in the editor window.

Each module in the Module Set has a /module record/ that
contains everything the app knows about the module:

- (optional) the name of the module

- (always) the source code (which could just be an empty or
  blank string)

- (optional) the filename and file handle of the source code

- (if there is a file handle) whether the code in the file is
  /stale/ (i.e.  the current source code has been edited and
  differs from the text in the file)

- (after assembly) the object code. Each module has an
  associated object code, which may be empty. The object code
  can be produced by a successful assembly (i.e. an assembly
  with no errors) or it can be obtained from the Editor.
  This allows object code to be read from a file or entered
  directly by the user.

- (after assembly) the assembly listing

- (after assembly) the metadata

**** Creating a module

- /Launch./ When the Sigma16 app is launched, it creates the
  initial Module Set containing a module whose source text is
  the empty string.  This module is automatically selected,
  and it is not associated with a file.  As always, you can
  see the source code text (which is empty) by going to the
  Editor.

- /Load example./ You can open one of the Examples: Go to the
  Examples page, navigate through the index pages to one of
  the programs, and select it.  This will add a new module to
  the Module Set, select it, and set its source code to the
  contents of the file.  The object code is set to empty.

- /Read file./ You can read a source file from your user
  space to create a module.  Go to the Modules page and click
  Choose Module.  This adds the result to the Module Set.
  The object code is set to empty.

- /Editor: New./ Go to the Editor page and click /New/.  This
  creates a new module whose name is =Anonymous= whose source
  text is the empty string.  The new module is selected and
  added to the Module Set (you can see it by going to the
  Modules page).  The previous text in the editor page is not
  lost; it remains in the module that had previous been
  selected.

**** Selecting a module

The Modules page shows which module is currently selected,
and its source text is visible if you go to the Editor page.

**** Changing a module
- /Edit text./
- /Save./
- /Select./

**** Closing a module
- /Close./

*** Modules page

- In Modules tab, click Choose Files
  - The dialogue shows .asm.txt, .lnk.txt, .obj.txt, .md.txt
  - To select all the relevant files in a directory, click
    the little box at the left on the row giving "Name, date
    modified, ..."
  - Click Open (or cancel)

*** Editor page
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: sec-editor
:END:

Editor operations on files and modules

Each operation that changes the editor buffer (New, Open,
Close) checks first to see whehter the buffer has been
changed since it was last saved.  If so, a dialogue asks
whether the file should be saved.

- New -- Check whether text in the editor buffer has been
  saved; if not, ask whether to save it.  Create a new module
  with empty text and no file name, add it to the module set,
  and select it as the current module.  Clear the text in the
  editor buffer.

- Open -- Check whether text in the editor buffer has been
  saved; if not, ask whether to save it.  Enter the open file
  dialogue where an existing file can be found by navigation
  or by typing in its name.  If the dialogue is cancelled,
  the module set and editor buffer are left unchanged.  If a
  file is selected in the dialogue, and it is already in the
  module set, then it is selected in the current module.
  Otherwise, a new module is created with the file's
  contents, and is selected as the current module.  and The
  file is loaded into the editor buffer and added to the
  module set.

- Refresh -- The file corresponding to the current module is
  read, and its contents are loaded into the editor buffer.

- SaveAs -- Enters the save file dialogue where the directory
  and file name can be chosen.  The editor buffer is written
  into this file.

- Save -- Writes the editor buffer into the current file and
  directory.  If either the module name or directory is not
  known, this reverts to a SaveAs.

- Select -- Opens a list of all modules; you can click one of
  them which is then set as the current module.
  
- Close -- Check whether text in the editor buffer has been
  saved; if not, ask whether to save it. The module is
  removed from the module set, and the editor buffer is
  cleared.  The first module (module number 0) is selected as
  the current module, but if there is no module at all, an
  empty module is created and selected as current (in effect,
  if there is only one module and you close it, an automatic
  New is performed).

- Example -- Reads in a simple example program and sets it as
  the current module.  This is a standalone program; you can
  simply click Editor: Example, then Assembler: Assemble,
  then Processor: Boot, and run the program.  This example is
  used in the first "getting started" tutorial.  The example
  program is also available in the Examples directory,
  accessible through Editor: Open.

Select is for switching among the existing modules, while New
and Open are for introducing a new module.

*** Files

A source module may be stored in a file, although this is not
required.  The assembler will produce several objects, which
can also be stored into files.

There is a standard convention for Sigma16 filenames.  All
filenames end with a two-part extension, such as =.asm.txt=.
The first part (=.asm=) tells Sigma16 what kind of
information the file contains, and the final part (=.txt=)
enables the computer you're running on to interpret the file
as plain text.  If you have a program named =MyProgram=, then
the files associated with it must be named as follows:

#+BEGIN_EXPORT html
<div style="overflow-x: auto">
#+END_EXPORT
| Description      | Language          | Filename          |
|------------------+-------------------+-------------------|
| source code      | assembly language | MyProgram.asm.txt |
| object code      | object language   | MyProgram.obj.txt |
| assembly listing | plain text        | MyProgram.lst.txt |
| metadata         | plain text        | MyProgram.md.txt  |
#+BEGIN_EXPORT html
</div>
#+END_EXPORT

The first part of the filename (=MyProgram=) is the /base
name/, and is the same for all the files for the module.  The
last part (=.asm.txt=) is the /extension/.

A filename can be specified either as a full path (the unique
identification of the file (=C:\\Users\...\prog.asm.txt=), or
as just a filename (myprogram.asm.txt) which is relative to
the current directory.

To edit a file, the modDir and modName are both optional.  An
edited file may have a module name specified with a module
statement.  To read or save a file, both the module directory
and name must be known.

There are two ways to read in a file:

- Go to the /Examples/ page, navigate to one of the examples,
  and open it.  This will create a new module record and read
  the =.asm.txt= file into the source code for that record.
  The object, assembly listing, and metadata for the module
  record are set to the empty string.

- Go to the /Modules/ page, click /Choose File/, and navigate
  to a source file anywhere in your file space. Selet that
  file, and it will be read into the source code for a newly
  created module record.

** Fixed and relocatable values

A value is a 16-bit word.  An assembly language program uses
expressions to denote values, but the actual underlying
quantity is a value.  A value consists of a word and several
attributes:

- word is a natural number in the range from 0 to 2^{16}-1.
- origin
  - if origin=Local, the value is defined within the module
  - if origin=External, the value is imported from another
    module
- movability
  - If movability = Relocatable, the value must be adjusted
    by the relocation constant when the module is relocated
  - If movability = Fixed, the value is not affected during
    relocation

*** Expressions

An expression is syntax that denotes a value.

A *name* must begin with a letter (a-z or A-Z), and may
contain letters, digits, or underscore characters.

Constants can be written in decimal, hexadecimal, or binary:

- *Decimal constants* consist of a sequence of digits, with
  an optional leading - sign.  Examples: 42 55039 -1

- *Hexadecimal constants* are written with a dollar sign $
  followed by four hex digits (0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 a b c d e
  f).  Examples: $0249 $c78a

- *Binary constants* are written with a hash sign # followed
  by any number of 0 or 1 characters.  You can write fewer
  than 16 bits; they will be padded on the left with zeros.
  Examples: #1101 #000100000001101

Expressions may contain arithmetic operators + - * /.

relocatable 

An expression can do arithmetic on a local label, but not on
an imported name.  The reason is that arithmetic requires
that the value of the name is known.  That's why an
expression like a equ rcd+5 can be used only after the label
rcd is defined: it enables the value of each name to be
calculated during pass 1.  But the values of imported names
are not known at all during assembly; they become defined
only during linking.  Such a value can affect the values of
words in the object code, but not their locations.

An expression is assembly language syntax that, when
evaluated, denotes a value (i.e. a 16-bit word).  Evaluation
takes place entirely at assembly time.  Expressions may be
labels, constants, or may be calculated.

*** Location counter
The assembler maintains a variable called the location
counter, which is the address where the next word of object
code will be loaded.  The location counter is a local value.
It is initialized to 0000 Relocatable.

When an instruction word or data word is generated, its
address is set to the current value of the location counter,
which is then incremented.

The org directive specifies a new value of the location
counter.  First the operand of the org statement is
evaluated.  This value must be local (it is an error if the
value is external).  The location counter and its movability
are set to the value and movability of the operand.

*** Attributes

A machine language program consists of words stored in memory
at particular addresses.  A word is just a collection of 16
bits; it has no type.

An assembly language program specifies all the words that
comprise a program.  In principle you could just write out
all the words as numbers, but this is difficult and prone to
errors.  Thw whole point of assembly language is to provide
notations that make it easier to specify these numbers, while
retaining total control---every single bit in the object code
is determined by the assembly language.

A *value* is a word of 16 bits.  Values do not have types;
their type depends entirely on usage.  Values may be used in
generating object code, either as the displacment field of an
RX instruction or as the operand of a data statement.

Every value is either *fixed* or *relocatable*.  If a module
is linked, then its relocatable values may be translated, but
the fixed values remain unchanged.

** Code generators
Each line of source code is an assembly language statement.
Unlike higher level languages, assembly language statements
are not nested.  There are three kinds of assembly language
statement:

- /Comments/ (blank lines, or lines beginning with ;)
- /Code/ statements define instructions or constant data
- /Directives provide metadata but don't generate any code

An assembly language statement contains one or more fields.
A field consists of non-space characters (with one exception:
a space may appear in a string literal).  Fields are
separated from each other by one or more white space
characters.

- Label.  The label field is optional.  If present, the label
  must be a name and it must begin in the first character of
  the line.  If the first character is a space, then that
  line has no label.
	
- Operation.  The operation field is an identifier that
  specifies an instruction or assembler directive.  It must
  be preceded by one or more white space characters.  Every
  statement (apart from a full line comment) must have an
  operation field.

- Operands.  The operands field specifies operands for an
  instruction or arguments for assembly directives.  There
  may be several operands, which must be separated by commas.
  Each type of statement (determined by the operation field)
  requires a specific syntax for the operands.  Most
  instructions and assembler directives require operands, but
  some do not.
	
- Comment.  All text that either (1) follows white space
  after the operands field, or (2) follows a semicolon (;),
  is a comment, and is ignored by the assembler.  If one or
  more of the other fields (label, operation, operands) is
  missing, the comment must be preceded by a semicolon to
  prevent it from being interpreted as operands.  The rule
  is: all text after a semicolon is a comment, and all text
  after white space following operands is a comment.  A
  statement where the first non-space character is a
  semicolon is a full line comment.  If the statement has no
  operands, then all text after the operation field is a
  comment.  It is good practice always to begin a comment
  with a semicolon.

*** Instructions

Assembly language statements generally correspond to the
instruction formats, but there is not an exact correspondence
for several reasons:

- Sometimes an instruction is written in assembly language
  with a field omitted which exists in the machine language
  code but is ignored.  For example, the instruction *cmp
  R1,R2* generates an RRR instruction, but the third operand
  field is omitted because the instruction requires only one
  operand, not two.  The assembler sets the unused operand to
  0, but the machine ignores it.  This is called a "don't
  care" field in the instruction.
  
- Sometimes two instructions look the same in assembly
  language but use different machine language instruction
  formats.  For example, *add R1,R2,R3* and *push R1,R2,R3*
  look similar, but *add* uses the RRR instruction format and
  *push* uses the EXP instruction format.  The reason for
  this is that there are not enough bits in the op field to
  accommodate all the instructions with three register
  operands, so an *expanding opcode* is used.  Thus push is
  represented with op=14, indicating EXP format, and the EXP
  variant is used for this instruction.
  
- The 4-bit fields are sometimes used to denote a register
  from the register file (R3), or a control register (mask),
  or a constant .  In assembly language the constants are
  written just as a number (e.g. shiftl R1,R2,5).  Control
  registers are written by name rather than their number in
  the control register file (e.g. getctl R3,mask).
  
- Some assembly language statements are *pseudoinstructions*.
  These are special cases of more general instructions.  For
  example, *and* is a pseudoinstruction which generates a
  *logicf* instruction specialised to perform a logical and.

An EXP instruction may use the fields op, d, ab, e, f, g, h.
The g and h fields can be combined into a single 8-bit field
gh All EXP instructions combine the a and b fields into a
single 8-bit field called ab.  Some EXP instructions combine
the g and h fields into a single 8-bit field called gh.  The
EXP format has the following variants.
  
- The RREXP format takes two register operands, which are in
  the e and f fields of the second word. The d field of the
  first word and the g and h fields of the second word are
  ignored (the assembler will set these to 0).  Any RREXP
  instruction could be reprsented as RRR, but there are only
  a few RRR opcodes avaiable, so uncommon instructions that
  require two registers are represented as RREXP.  Example:
  *execute R5,R6* is RREXP.

- The RCEXP format takes two register operands; the first is
  a general register and the second is a control register.
  An example of the operand field is *R3,mask*.  The operands
  are in the e and f fields of the second word.  The d field
  of the first word and the g and h fields of the second word
  are ignored (the assembler will set these to 0.)  The first
  operand is an element of the register file (for example,
  R4).  The second operand is a control register, which is
  specified by a 4-bit number.  In assembly language, we
  normally refer to the control registers by name rather than
  number, to make it easier to remember which is which.  For
  example, *getctl R3,status* has RCEXP format.
  
- The RRREXP format takes three register operands, which are
  in the f, g, and h fields of the second word. An example of
  the operand field is $R1,R2,R3*.  The d field of the first
  word and the e field of the second word are ignored (the
  assembler will set these to 0).  The RRREXP instructions
  would be a natural fit for the RRR format, but there are
  not enough RRR opcodes available, so the EXP format is used
  to expand the number of instructions that can be
  represented.  For example, *push R5,R8,R9* has RRREXP
  format.
  
- The RRKEXP format takes two register operands and a 4-bit
  constant number.  An example of the operand field is
  *R1,R2,13*.  The register operands are in the f and g
  fields of the second word, and constant is in the h field
  of the second word.  The d field of the first word and the
  e field of the second word are ignored (the assembler sets
  these to 0).  For example, *shiftr R3,R6,7* has RRKEXP
  format.
  
- The RRKKEXP format takes two register operands and two
  4-bit constant binary number operands.  The register
  operands are in the e and f fields of the second word,
  while the two constants are in the g and h fields.  The d
  field of the first word is ignored (the assembler sets it
  to 0).
  
- The RRXEXP format takes two register operands as well as a
  memory address specified with an 8-bit offset and index
  register.  Thus these instructions require three registers
  to be specified, as well as the offset.  Thus every bit of
  both instruction words is needed to represent an RRXEXP
  format instruction.  In assembly language, the memory
  address is written as *offset[Rh]* where *offset* is an
  -bit binary number and Rh is a register.  The effective
  memory address is *offset+Rh*. This is similar to ordinary
  memory addresses; the only difference is that it uses an
  8-bit offset rather than a 16-bit displacement. For
  example, *save R1,R9,2[R14]* has RRKEXP format.

Expressions, values and relocatables

- An expression is syntax: 23, -5, $b23e, struc+5,
  arrEnd-arrStart

- A value denotes a word (it is a number) and is the result
  of evaluating an expression

- A value is marked as either relocatable or fixed

- Expressions may occur in
  - Displacement field of an assembly language statement; the
    value of the expression is placed in the displacement
    field of the corresponding machine language instruction.
  - If a displacement value is relocatable, its address is
    recorded in the list of addressess of words to be
    relocated
  - Right hand side of an equ statement.  The value may be
    fixed or relocatable.  The name (the left hand side) is
    defined as a new identifier, the definition line is the
    line containing the equ, the value is the evaluation of
    the right hand side, which may be either fixed or
    relocatable.  Identifiers used in the expression on the
    RHS have the line number included in their usage lines.
  - But identifiers that appear in an expression (even if
    relocatable) are not recorded in the relocation list;
    only displacements are placed in the relocation list.

**** Instruction set

The following sections describe the instructions in groups
organized by their function.  Some of the groups contain
instructions with different formats.  From the programmer's
perspective the function is more important, so these groups
are useful in finding the right instruction to use.  (From
the perspective of designing a digital circuit to impleemnt
the architecture, the format is essential.)

*** data

The data statement specifies a sequence of constants to be
placed in consecutive memory locations starting at the
location counter, subject to relocation.  Its argument is a
list of one or more 4-digit hex constants separated by
commas.

A long block of data can be broken up into several data
statements.  Suppose x1, x2, etc are 4-digit hex constants.
Then

#+BEGIN_SRC Sigma16 exports: code
data  x1,x2,x3,x4,x5,x6
#+END_SRC

is equivalent to

#+BEGIN_SRC Sigma16 exports: code
data x1,x2,x3
data x4,x5,x6
#+END_SRC

Suppose

- The module's relocation constant is r
- The location counter has been set to c
- The i'th constant (counting from 0) in a data statement is
  x.

Then the linker will set mem[r+c+i] := x.

One point to watch out for is that an assembly language data
statement uses $ to indicate that a number is a hex constant
(e.g. $03b7) but the object language data statement requires
all numbers to be 4-digit hex constants, and does not require
(or allow) a preceding $ character

** Directives

A directive is an assembly language statement that gives
further information about how to translate the program to
object code and how to link the code with other modules.
Directirves specify metadata but they don't generate an
instruction or constant data.

*** module

A program may be organized as a collection of modules, where
each module appears in a separate file.  When several modules
are present, each one needs a unique name.  The /module/
statement declares the name of the module, which is specified
in the label field.  There are no operands.  The following
statement says that this is the object code for module named
/abc/:

#+BEGIN_SRC Sigma16 exports: code
abc   module 
#+END_SRC

A /module/ statement is optional.  If none is present in a
file, the module is anonymous.  If a file does contain a
/module/ statement, it must be the first statement in the
file, although it may be preceded by comments and blank
lines.  It is illegal for a file to contain more than one
/module/ statement.

An anonymous module can import other modules, but other
modules cannot import anything exported from an anonymous
module.  This means, in effect, that an anonymous module is
useful only as a main program.

It is good practice for the main program to have a module
statement; in effect, this is the name of the program as well
as the name of the module.

An assembly language file should have a name of the form
basename.asm.txt.  If there is a module statement /modname
module/, then basename should be /modname/.  For example, the
file Heapsort.asm.txt might contain the statement /Heapsort
module/.  If there is no module statement, basename is
arbitrary.

*** import

The import statement states that the value of an identifier
is defined in another module.  During the assembly of the
module containing the import, the identifier is given a
provisional value of 0, but this will be replaced by the
actual value by the linker.  For example,

#+BEGIN_SRC Sigma16 exports: code
x   import  Mod1,x
y   import  Mod1,abc
#+END_SRC

says that x is a name that can be used in this module, but it
is defined in Mod1; y can be used in this module but it is
defined in Mod1 under the name abc.

*** export

An export statement says that the module is making the value
of a symbol available for use in other modules, which may
import it.  The statement takes two operands: the name being
exported and the value, which must be a 4-digit hex constant.
It makes no difference whether the name is relocatable, as
the linker performs any relocation before writing the
exported value into other modules that import it.  Examples:

#+BEGIN_SRC Sigma16 exports: code
export  haltcode,0
export  fcn,002c
#+END_SRC

The export statement states that the value of an identifier
should be made available for other modules to import.  For
example, this module defines a function and exports it so
other modules can import and call it:

#+BEGIN_SRC Sigma16 exports: code
Mod1     module
         export fcn

fcn      add    R1,R1,R1
         jump   0[R12]
#+END_SRC

** Assembly listing

The first section of the assembly listing shows each line of
the source program.  The line number appears first, followed
by the memory address that the instruction on this line will
be placed in.  The address is given as a 4 digit hexadecimal
number, and it is binary (not two's complement).  Next comes
the machine language code generated by the line of source
code.  If the line contains a two-word instruction, there
will be two 4-digit hexadecimal values; for a one-word
instruction there will be one hex number, and if the line
doesn't produce any code these fields will be blank.  After
the code, the original source statement appears.

The second section of the assembly listing is the *Symbol
Table*.  This shows each identifier (or "symbol") that
appears in the program, the address allocated for the symbol,
the source code line where it was defined, and the source
code lines where it was used.

*** equ

#+BEGIN_SRC Sigma16 exports: code
codeWrite  equ  2
codeRead   equ  1
#+END_SRC

The expression in an equ can calculate the size of an object:

#+BEGIN_SRC Sigma16 exports: code
astart     data 5
           data 9
           data 78
aend
asize      equ  aend-astart
#+END_SRC

*** reserve

The =reserve= statement has one operand, which is a numeric
constant.  The assembler increments the location counter by
the value of the operand.

This can be used to reserve a block of memory, for example to
hold a stack or heap data structure.

#+BEGIN_SRC Sigma16 exports: code
asize   equ    100
n       reserve asize
#+END_SRC

If the operand of a =reserve= statement is a symbol defined
by an =equ=, that definition must precede the =reserve=
statement.  This is because pass 1 of the assembler needs to
calculate the address of each code word, and an =equ= that
follows the =reserve= statement would not become known until
after the size of the =reserve= is needed.

*** org

The org statement sets the location counter to a specified
address.  Subsequent instructions and data will be placed in
memory at contiguous locations starting from that address.

#+BEGIN_SRC Sigma16 exports: code
    org   35     ; subsequent code starts from address 0023
#+END_SRC

The assembler initializes the location counter to 0 before it
begins translating an assembly language module.  Every module
begins implicitly with org 0.

# There is one argument, which is an expression denoting the
# new value of the location counter.  The location counter
# has an associated attribute that specifies either
# Relocatable or Fixed.  The org statement sets this
# attribute, as well as the numeric value of the location
# counter, to the value of the operand.  org @+50 ; skip 50
# words (Relocatable)


* Object code and linker
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: sec-linker
:END:

Small programs often consist of just one module (or file).
The assembler translates the assembly language source code
into machine language which is then executed by the
processor.

However, there are several reasons for breaking up larger
programs into several modules.  It's easier to work with
several modules of reasonable size rather than one gigantic
file.  A module may provide generic services that can be
incorporated into many programs.  Programs can be simplified
if they use libraries for common tasks, rather than
implementing everything from scratch.  It is faster to
assemble small files than large ones.

When a program consists of several modules, each one can be
assembled separately.  However, the resulting machine
language is not executable if it refers to procedures or
other values defined in another module.  An instruction in
module A cannot refer to a word X in module B unless it knows
the address of X, and when module A is assembled it knows
nothing about module B.

To produce an executable program, its modules need to be
combined into a single executable module, with all the
addresses resolved.  This is called *linking*.

Sigma16 supports linking.  The system is designed so that
programs that consist of just one standalone module can be
executed directly, without linking.  This means you can
ignore the issues of modules and linking if you just want to
write a andalone program.

** Object language

Object code is expressed in a textual language, so the object
code is readable by a human (at least, by a human who
understands machine language).  For example, binary data is
specified using four hexadecimal characters rather than a
word of binary data.

*** Object statement syntax

The object language has a simple syntax and only a few types
of statement.  Each object statement is written on one line.
It begins with a keyword indicating the type of statement,
followed by one or more spaces, followed by an operand field
which must not contain any white space.  The operand field is
a comma-separated list of tokens; each token is either a hex
constant or an identifier.

- In the object language, hex constants are written as four
  characters, using digits 0-9 a-f.  Unlike assembly
  language, a hex constant is not preceded by $.  There is no
  need for this, as all numbers are written in hex in object
  code.  Assembly language allows both hex and decimal
  numbers so there needs to be a way to tell them apart.

- Identifiers have the same syntax as in assembly language: a
  string of letters, digits, and underscore characters,
  beginning with a letter.

The object language has seven statements: =module=, =org=,
=data=, =import=, =export=, and =relocate=.  Some of these
are related to corresponding statements in assembly language,
but their syntax is different and in some cases they may
contain different information.

*** module

*** org

*** data

data x0,x1,...,x_{j-1}

Let xs be the list of j words in a data statement, and llc is
the linker location counter.  For each word x, the linker
performs:

#+BEGIN_SRC Sigma16 exports: code
mem[llc] := x
llc := llc + 1
#+END_SRC

*** import

General form

#+BEGIN_SRC Sigma16 exports: code
import  modName,externalName,address,field
#+END_SRC

Examples

#+BEGIN_SRC Sigma16 exports: code
import  Mod2,abc,03c4,dist
import  Mod3,ybit,03be,g
#+END_SRC

*** export

*** relocate

The relocate statement specifies a list of addresses of words
that must be relocated.  Suppose the value x is specified in
a relocate statement, and the linker is relocating the module
by offset y.  Then the linker will set mem[x+y] = obj[x]+y.

#+BEGIN_SRC Sigma16 exports: code
relocate hex4,hex4,...
#+END_SRC

General form:

The relocate statement specifies a list of addresses, which
refer to object code words in the module.  The effect is to
add the linker location counter (llc) to each object code
word.

code[addr] := code[addr] + llc

#+BEGIN_SRC Sigma16 exports: code
relocate  addr,addr,...,addr
#+END_SRC

Each location is relcated.  The word The addresses 

** Module metadata

The assembler and linker create metadata files which enable
the emulator to show the assembly language statement
corresponding to the instruction currently being executed.
The metadata is not part of the machine language, and the
emulator doesn't look at it in order to execute the program.
It is entirely optional: the emulator can run a program
without any metadata, although without it the emulator cannot
display the current assembly language source statement.  This
section explains how the metadata works and the format of the
files.

The emulator attempts to show the assembly language source as
the program runs, and it highlights the current and next
instruction.  To do this, the emulator needs to have some
information that isn't present in the object code.  This
extra information is supplied in a separate metadata file
produced by the assembler and the linker.

An object file foo.obj.txt may have a corresponding metadata
file foo.omd.txt ("object metadata").  An executable file
foo.exe.txt may have a corresponding metadata file
foo.xmd.txt ("executable metadata").  The format of the
metadata is identical for object and executable; the reason
for the distinction is that the user might have a program
with main program foo.asm.txt, and later give the executable
the same name foo.  In that case, there will be separate
metadata files for the object and the executable.

The metadata contains the source code in two forms: plain
text and with html tags for highlighting the fields.  In
addition, the metadata contains a mapping from address to
source code line number.

The metadata file format is parsed in order to populate
several data structures that enable the emulator to The
metadata contains the lines of text of the assembly listing.
These lines contain the address, the object code at that
address, and the assembly language source statement.  Each
line of the assembly listing appears t The emulator displays
most lines of the assembly listing with the same field
highlighting

A metadata file contains two sections: the ASmap followed by
the source listing text.  A metadata file must have the
following contents:

$a0,s0,a1,s1,$ $a2,s2, ...,$ $a_{n-1},s_{n-1}$

When the pc contains address $a_i$ then the source statement
$s_i$ should be displayed.

- =fsmap= /n/
- comma separated list of /n/ numbers, which may be split
  into lines
- =source= /n/
- /n/ lines of html giving the assembly listing.  Each line
  appears twice: first a "plain" form, followed by a
  "decorated" form that contains html span elements for
  highlighting the fields of the text

Here is an example of a metadata file:

#+BEGIN_SRC Sigma16 exports: code
fasmap 17
14,14,15,15,16,16,17,17,18,19
19,20,20,21,21,22,24

   1 0000           <span class='FIELDLABEL'> ... </span>
#+END_SRC

** Linker
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: sec-linker
:END:



- GUI: selected module is main program and also receives the
  executable.  All other modules are linked, and their object
  code is placed after that of the selected module.  It is an
  error if any module has not been assembled.  The order of
  the object code depends on the order of the modules in the
  module list, which is essentially arbitrary, except that
  the selected module always comes first in the executable.

** Booter
*** Executable code

  An executable module is written in the same language as
  object modules.  The only difference is that an executable
  module must contain only these types of statement: module,
  data, org.  It is now allowed to contain any of the
  following statments: import, export, relocate.

  If an assembly language program doesn't contain any import
  or export directives, then its object code won't contain
  any import, export, or relcate statements.  In this case,
  the object code is already executable and does not require
  linking: it can be booted directly by the processor.

  The booter (invoked by clicking the Boot button in the
  processor page) reads in the currently selected module and
  checks to see whether it is a valid executable module.  If
  so, it loads the code into the memory.  If not, it
  indicates that the program cannot be booted.


* Programming
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: sec-programming
:END:

** Structure of a program

Simple ("static") variabls need to be declared with a data
statement, which also gives an initial value.

#+BEGIN_SRC Sigma16 exports: code
x  data  23
#+END_SRC

This means: allocate a word in memory for x and initialize it
to 23.  The data statements should come after the trap
instruction that terminates the program

The software conventions are:
- R14 - stack pointer
- R13 - return address
- R12

** How to perform commmon tasks

*** Using extract
A special case is to move a Boolean from one place to
another.
- A Boolean is a bit in a register, so it takes two 4-bit
  fields to specify an arbitrary Boolean
- Would like to make it easy to implement b := c, where b and
  c are arbitrary Booleans
- This would require two 4-bit fields for each of b and c,
  for a total of four 4-bit fields
- The Exp format could accommodate this
- But this could also be done using the extract instruction
- Therefore it should either be omitted, or else be a pseudo
  instruction that generates an extract

The extract instruction is not essential: it can be performed
by a sequence of shift and logic instructions.  However, an
extract instruction is faster than the equivalent sequence of
shifts and logic, and it also makes a program more readable
by making the intention clear.

Pseudoinstruction

Copy a bit

Invert a bit

Generate a field mask

The field pseudoinstruction loads a word into the destination
register Rd; this word consists of 1 bits in the specified
field (g,h) and 0 in all other bit positions.  This provides
a field mask that can be used with logic instructions for a
variety of purposes.

- General form: *field Rd,g,h*
- Pseudo-instruction:  *injecti Rd,R0,g,h*
- Assembler format: RKK

Semantics
- Rd.i = 1 for g <= i <- h
- Rd.i = 0 for i < g or i > h

Example:

#+BEGIN_SRC Sigma16 exports: code
 field   R3,4,  ; R3 := 0fc0
#+END_SRC

Using a field mask
- invert it to give negative mask
- and R1 with mask to clear bits outside the field
- and R1 with negative mask to clear only the field 
- xor R1 with mask to invert bits in the field

*** Copying one register to another

Sometimes you want to copy a value from one register to
another: R3 := R12.  There isn't an instruction specifically
for this purpose, because there is no need: just use the add
instruction:

#+BEGIN_SRC Sigma16 exports: code
add R3,R12,R0 ; R3 := R12
#+END_SRC
  
Since R12 + 0 = R12, this copies the value in R12 into R3.

** Compilation

There are two ways to handle variables:

The statement-by-statement style: Each statement is compiled
independently.  The pattern is: load, arithmetic, store.
Straightforward but inefficient.
  
The register-variable style: Keep variables in registers
across a group of statements.  Don't need as many loads and
stores.  More efficient.  You have to keep track of whether
variables are in memory or a register.  Use comments to show
register usage.  Real compilers use this style.  Use this
style if you like the shorter code it produces.
  
We'll translate the following program fragment to assembly
language, using each style:

#+BEGIN_SRC Sigma16 exports: code
x = 50;
y = 2*z;
x = x+1+z;
#+END_SRC

Statement-by-statement style

#+BEGIN_SRC Sigma16 exports: code
; x = 50;
     lea    R1,$0032   ; R1 = 50
     store  R1,x[R0]   ; x = 50

; y = 2*z;
     lea    R1,$0002   ; R1 = 2
     load   R2,z[R0]   ; R2 = z
     mul    R3,R1,R2   ; R3 = 2*z
     store  R3,y[R0]   ; y = 2*z

; x = x+1+z;
     load   R1,x[R0]   ; R1 = x
     lea    R2,1[R0]   ; R2 = 1
     load   R3,z[R0]   ; R3 = z
     add    R4,R1,R2   ; R4 = x+1
     add    R4,R4,R3   ; R4 = x+1+z
     store  R4,x[R0]   ; x = x+1+z

Comparison of the styles

Statement by statement.
- Each statement is compiled into a separate block of code.
- Each statement requires loads, computation, then stores.
- A variable may appear in several different registers.
- There may be a lot of redundant loading and storing.
- The object code corresponds straightforwardly to the source
  code, but it may be unnecessarily long.
  
Register variable
- The instructions corresponding to the statemnts are mixed
  together.
- Some statements are executed entirely in the registers.
- A variable is kept in the same register across many
  statments.
- The use of loads and stores is minimised.
- The object code is concise, but it's harder to see how it
  corresponds to the source code.
- It's possible to have a mixture of the styles: you don't
  have to follow one or the other all the time.

** Errors: avoiding, finding, and fixing

** Procedure call and return

A common usage of save and restore is to simplify procedure
call and return.  When a procedure is called, store the
registers onto the execution stack when a procedure is called
(using save), and then to load them back from the stack when
the procedure is returned (restore).  Normally, the format of
a stack frame has a fixed location for saving the registers,
at a small offset from the beginning of the frame.  A
register called the /stack pointer/ gives the address of the
frame, and the offset for saving the registers is normally a
small value (such as 3 or similar).

*** Critical regions

A testset instruction is not semantically equivalent to a
load followed by a store.  Consider this example:

#+BEGIN_SRC Sigma16 exports: code
; (1) testset
     testset   R1,mutex[R0]
#+END_SRC

It is not the same as

#+BEGIN_SRC Sigma16 exports: code
; (2) sequence of instructions
     load     R1,mutex[R0]
     lea      R2,1[R0]
     store    R2,mutex[R0]
#+END_SRC

The essential difference is that (1) executes as an atomic
operation, but (2) does not, and this could lead to errors in
mutual exclusion, which could lead in turn to fatal errors,
crashes, and security violations.

Consider, for example, a situation where two processes are
sharing mutex to control access to a critical retion.

  an interrupt could occor after the load and before the
store.  Suppose, for example, that initially mutex = 0 and
the sequence is executed.  Another process could be
performing a similar sequence of instructions on the same
mutex variable.

*** Robust programming

*Use a systematic programming process

- Start with a high level algorithm
- Then translate that to the low level ("if b then goto
  label") form
- Translate the low level to assembly language, keeping the
  higher level versions as comments
  
*Use comments both to develop the program and to document it*

- Write the comments first, as you develop the program.
  There should already be some good comments (e.g. the
  algorithm) before any instructions at all have been
  written.
- Don't fall into the trap of hacking out instructions and
  then adding comments later: this loses the benefits that
  documention offers as you're writing the code.
  
*How to write good comments*

- Keep the high level and low level algorithms as comments
- Comment each instruction
- Use the comments to explain what your program is doing, not to
  explain what an instruction does.
- Assume that the reader already knows the language, but not
  the details of your program.

*** Error messages

*** Runtime debugging

*What if an instruction doesn't do what you expected?*

- Execute the program to the point where the mysterious
  instruction is about to be executed, but has not yet
  executed.  (To do this, you can step through the program,
  or set a breakpoint.)
  
- Make sure you know what the instruction is supposed to do
  (check the User Guide).
  
- Looking at the state of the registers and memory, carefully
  predict what you expect the instruction to do.
  
- Execute the one instruction (click Step) and compare the
  state of the machine with your prediction.
  
- Make sure the instruction has not been modified in memory.
  Compare the machine language produced by the assembler with
  the *current* contents of the word or words in memory where
  the instruction is located.

*** Breakpoints

*(Note: the breakpoint system is not fully implemented yet;
the following describes a temporary breakpoint facility.)*

A breakpoint is the address of an instruction; when the
machine is about to execute that instruction (i.e. when the
pc contains that address) the emulator will halt execution,
enabling the programmer to examine the state of registers and
memory.  To set a breakpoint, click Breakpoint and enter the
instruction address you want to stop at in the dialogue box.
There are several control buttons.  Refresh means "read the
contents of the text in the box, which must be a $ followed
by a 4 hex digit address".  Whenever you change the text, you
should click Refresh.  The Enable button toggles the
breakpoint on and off.  The Close button hides the Breakpoint
dialogue box.  Here's an example.  Suppose you want to stop
execution of a program at address 00f6:

- Click Breakpoint
- Enter $00f6
- Click Refresh
- Click Enable
- Click Close
- Click Run

The execution will run until the pc becomes equal to 00f6 and
will then stop.

Click Refresh, then Enable, then Close.  Then click Run, and
the emulator will run at full speed until the pc reaches the
specified value; then it will stop so you can examine the
state of the machine.

* Command line tools

Several components of the app can be used by issuing commands in a
shell.  To use them, you need to install them (see /Installation/
beloe).  There is one command, /sigma16/, which takes zero or more
optional arguments.  If present, the first argument specifies what
to do (e.g. assemble or link) and the second argument specifies
what files to use.

Suppose your shell is in a directory that contains an assembly
language file, =ArrayMax.asm.txt=.  To asssemble it, enter the
following command.  Use just the base name of the file
(=ArrayMax=), and omit the extensions (=.asm.txt=).

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
sigma16 assemble ArrayMax
#+END_EXAMPLE

This will produce an object code file (=ArrayMax.obj.txt=), an
assembly listing file (=ArrayMax.lst.txt=), and a metadata file
(=ArrayMax.md.txt=).


* FAQ: Frequently Asked Questions


* Installation

You can run most of Sigma16 in a web browser -- there's
nothing to download, nothing to install.  Visit the Sigma16
Home Page in your browser:

#+BEGIN_EXPORT html
<div style="overflow-x: auto">
#+END_EXPORT
[Sigma16 home page](https://jtod.github.io/home/Sigma16/)
#+BEGIN_EXPORT html
</div>
#+END_EXPORT

Click on the link to launch the app.  It will run in your
browser; you don't have to install anything.  The Home page
also contains links to the source code and further
information about the project.

** Command line tools

Sigma16 also contains some advanced features that use the
command line in a shell.  These features include text
commands for assembling and linking programs, and for running
the circuit simulator.  These features require some software
installation.  In addition, building Sigma16 from soure
requires some additional software that must be installed.
All of the software required is free and open source, and all
of it runs on Windows, Macintosh, and Gnu/Linux.

*** node and npm

*** Configuring the shell

Shell running bash

Add the following to your .bashrc file, but replace /Users/
yourlogin/ Documents/ path/ to/ with your own file location.
In a bash shell running on cygwin, try /Users/ yourlogin.

#+BEGIN_SRC Sigma16 exports: code
SIGMA16=/Users/yourlogin/Documents/path/to/SigmaProject/Sigma16
export SIGMA16
alias helloworld="node ${SIGMA16}/app/helloworld.js"
#+END_SRC

*** Testing the installation

#+BEGIN_SRC Sigma16 exports: code
$ node --version
v16.5.0
#+END_SRC

*** Building Sigma16

The Web version of Sigma16 contains several files that need
to be built from source.  Of course, if you launch the app
from the Sigma16 Home Page you don't need to worry about
that: you get a fully-built version.

Use emacs to build *.html from source *.org

#+BEGIN_SRC Sigma16 exports: code
^C ^E h h
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC Sigma16 exports: code
$ npm install -g wabt
$ wat2wasm emcore.wat --enable-threads
#+END_SRC

** In case of problems

If you encounter a problem with the app, please file a bug
report.  It is essential in a bug report (for any software,
not just Sigma16) to provide as much as possible of the
following information.

- State what version of the software you are running.  This
  is visible in the Welcome page, as well as the User Guide
  and the Options page.

- State what browser and operating system you are using.
  There are some incompatibilities between Chrome, Firefox,
  Edge, and Safari, as well as differences between operating
  systems.
  
- Describe what the problem was.

- Provide the source code of the assembly language program
  you are running.

- If possible, provide some photos or screen shots showing
  the app at the point where the problem arose.  Smartphone
  photos are fine.  Try to show the processor display,
  including the registers.

Include svg figure

Here is an svg figure RRRformat.  ok for html, gives latex
error slash includesvg undefined

# {{{svgfig(RRRformat)}}}

** Configuration
- setArch(16)
- setArch(32)
  
** To do
- GUI, Arch, ISA, Typesetting
- This example has no leading spaces:

#+BEGIN_SRC Sigma16 exports: code
loop  lea  R3,42     ; R3 := 42
#+END_SRC

- This example starts with ordinary spaces, and all but one are
  ignored by the exporter, so this instruction won't be properly
  indented:

#+BEGIN_SRC Sigma16 exports: code
     lea  R3,42     ; R3 := 42
#+END_SRC

- This example has a special space character at the beginning. It
  isn't obtrusive in the text editor, bnt it ensures that the html
  output won't ignore the leading spaces:

#+BEGIN_SRC Sigma16 exports: code
     lea  R3,42     ; R3 := 42
#+END_SRC

- AsmStdErrors uses old logicw, old syntax for logicb and extract
  - Should include logicf, new syntax for logicb, and new
    pseudoinstructions for logicf and logicb
- Branch needs redesign, the test program is no longer consistent
  with the program
- Ctl.asm.txt check execution

** Release notes

- Permalink to the latest live release
  - The following permalink to the Sigma16 Home Page will always
    give you the latest release:
    [[https://jtod.github.io/home/Sigma16/]].
  - The github page for Sigma16 contains the current development
    code, which changes frequently and is not stable.  The github
    page also contains links to versions that were released
    since 2019.

- v3.9.0, February 2025
  - Refinements to user guide and user interface
  - Further development of EXP instructions
  - Used in CS1 Spring 2025, CA Autumn 2025, CS1 Spring 2025

- v3.7.1, February 2024

    program has been re-edited and re-assembled

- v3.7.0, January 2024

- v3.5.0, January 2023
  - No change to the Core instruction set
  - revised the Standard instructions, some changes to
    representation of standard instructions
  - added family of branch instructions

- v3.4.3, August 2022

- v3.4.2, January 2022

- v3.4.1, January 2022
  - Organise architecture into Core and Standard subsets

- v3.4.0
  - Bit indexing is changed to "little end" style.  The least
    significant bit has index 0, and the most significant bit
    has index 15.
  - The architecture is organized into precisely defined
    subsets: Core and Standard

- v3.3.2, April 2021
  - There is no change in the architecture
  - The software is modified to enable it to continue working
    when a planned change to web browsers occurs in May 2021.
    The program runs on a hosted web server that enables it to
    work fully with cross origin isolation.

- v3.2.3, development from April 2021

- v3.2.2, March 2021
  - A bug in breakpoints is fixed
  - In addition, there is a new way to specify breakpoings
    using trap
  - When the emulator stops, the memory display is correct; you
    no longer need to refresh it

- v3.2.1, February 2021
  - v3.2 brings several changes that will be visible to users
    of previous versions of Sigma16.
  - /cmplt, cmpeq, cmpgt are removed./
  - Instead, use the =cmp= instruction, which sets the condition
    code (=R15=), and then use any of the conditional jump
    instructions =jumplt=, =jumple=, =jumpeq=, =jumpne=, =jumpge=,
    =jumpgt=.
  - Rationale: There are more Booleans in the condition code than
    just less-than, equal, and greater-than.  The new style
    accomodates all the conditions in a uniform manner, but the old
    style does not.  v3.1 already supported =cmp= and the
    conditional jumps.  Here's an example:
#+BEGIN_SRC Sigma16 exports: code
; Old style -- these instructions have been removed
     cmplt   R1,R2,R3      ; R1 := R2 < R3
     jumpt   R1,loop[R0]   ; if R2 < R3 then goto loop
; New style -- use the following instead
     cmp     R2,R3         ; compare R2 with R3
     jumplt  loop[R0]      ; if R2 < R3 then goto loop
#+END_SRC
  - /jumpf is renamed to jumpz, and jumpt is renamed to jumpnz./ The
    new names stand for /jump if zero/ and /jump if not zero/.  Most
    old programs will use =jumpf= or =jumpt= only after =cmplt=,
    =cmpeq=, or =cmpgt=, but following =cmp= you should use one of
    the conditional jumps listed above.
     - Rationale: The new names reflect more accurately what the
       instructions do.  The decision about whether to jump depends on
       whether the entire register contains 0; it isn't a decision
       based on checking just a single bit.
  - The following changes do not require modifying old programs;
    they just relax the syntax rules so some programs would no
    longer give an error message.
    - /[R0] is optional./ In previous versions of Sigma16, every
      displacement requires the index register to be stated
      explicitly, even if it's =R0=: for example, =load R3,xyz[R0]=.
      Now, the =[R0]= can be omitted, although you can include it if
      you wish.  Thus =load R3,xyz= and =load R3,xyz[R0]= are
      equivalent.  (Rationale: The reason for requiring =[R0]= in
      the past was to emphasise the regularity of the instruction
      representation.  However, a primary aim of the design of
      Sigma16 is to provide subsetting of the architecture, which
      supports a spiral approach to learning computer architecture.
      Another aim is to provide a good platform for schools or other
      students who will just learn a little of the system.  Removing
      the requirement for =[R0]= simplifies the language for a
      beginner.  Furthermore, for an experienced expert programmer
      it's more readable to omit the =[R0]= as this reduces the
      amount of clutter in the code.)
    - /Allow lower case "r" in register names./ In previous
      versions, elements of the register file required an upper case
      =R=: for example, =R8=.  Now you can write =r8= as well as
      =R8=, and both names refer to the same register.  (Of course
      the same holds for the rest of the register file.)  This is a
      trivial syntax issue.  There's no technical reason to prefer
      =r8= or =R8=; it's just a matter of personal preference.  It
      may be easier to read =r8= because the lower case =r= is
      shorter than the digits.  It's good style to use either the
      =Rn= or =rn= form consistently, but the assembly language
      doesn't enforce that. Labels are case sensitive but registers
      are not.  Labels are case-sensitive, so =xyz= and =XYZ= are
      distinct names, but registers are not labels, and registers
      are not case sensitive.
  - There are some changes to the machine language that don't affect
    assembly language programs.
    - Some of the opcodes have changed, so programs need to be
      reassembled.
    - The word logic instructions =inv=, =and=, =or=, =xor= are
      now pseudoinstructions that generate the =logicf=
      instruction.  The assembly language syntax is the same as
      before; only the underlying machine language representation
      is different
    - There are some new instructions and features, as well as some
      instructions and features that have been in the architecture
      for some time but weren't documented in the User Gude.  These
      won't affect existing programs.

- v3.1.3, March 2020

- v3.1.2, March 2020

- v3.1.1, Febrary 2020
  - Give error message on invalid characters, refresh memory display
    on pause or halt, logic instructions

- v3.1.0, February 2020

- v3.0.34, January 2020

- v3.0.26, December 2019

- v3.0.25, December 2019

- v3.0.24, December 2019
  - emulator working, emu listing highlighting

- v3.0.18, December 2025

- v3.0.0, March 2019
  - Beginning of a complete rewrite of the system in JavaScript.
  - It became clear, after extensive work, that Haskell is not ideal
    for software that needs a nontrivial graphical user interface.
    (Haskell is elegant and efficient for the assembler and
    emulator, and for a text user interface, but not for a
    graphicsal user interface.)
  - Furthermore, there were serious problems in gtk3.
  - Since portability is essential for Sigma16, I decided to
    redesign and reimplement it in JavaScript, so it would run in
    modern web browsers with no software installation.

- v2.4.7, February 2019
  - Improvements to commands and user interface

- v2.3.65, January 2019
  - Used in CS1S course at Glasgow through Spring 2019

- v2.3.7
  - Modified the Haskell program to support the GUI by communicating
    with a web browser, in order to avoid using any of the Haskell
    gui tools.
  - To run Sigma16, you need to download the Haskell app and launch
    it, and open a specific link in a running browser.
  - Haskell, using a browser for the GUI
  - The main program runs as a Haskell app, and it communicates with
    the browser, sending commands to display information and
    receiving responses to control the program.

- v1.4.4, February 2016
  - Standalone Haskell
  - User interface defined by gtk calls, without glade dependency

- v0.1.7, October 2011
  - User interface implemented in gtk2 using glade to specify layout
    of graphical interface
  - Used for many years in several introductory sysems courses at
    Glasgow.  Used in level 1 systems though 20216
  - Used in the IT Systems & Networks course at Glasgow
    through at least 2025.
  - However, this version is obsolete and it's recommended to use
    the current release, available on github at
    [[https://jtod.github.io/home/Sigma16/]].  The current release has
    an improved architecture, is portable, has extensive
    documentation, is much faster, includes better software tools,
    and has a better user interface.

- v0.1.0, October 2010
  - Standalone program implemented in Haskell, using gtk for the
    user interface
  - User inteface defined using glade
  - Contains assembler and emulator
  - Used in CS2, level 2 computer systems course, starting in
    2010-11

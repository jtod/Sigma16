# {{{S16version()}}} is defined by VersionMacro.org.  It gives the
# version number and date, and is defined by make setVersion

# To build User Guide
#   Build VERSION.txt and VersionMacro.org: cd $SIGMA16; make setVersion
#   Edit  Sigma16UserGuideText.org
#   Open Sigma16UserGuide.org in emacs
#   Generate html:  ctl-c ctl-e h h
#   Generate tex:   ctl-c ctl-e l l
#   Generate pdf:   ctl-c ctl-e l p
#   pdflatex Sigma16UserGuide
#   pdflatex --shell-escape Sigma16UserGuide
#   cd $SIGMA16; make docs/UserGuide/Sigma16UserGuide.pdf

# Does this do anything?  Seems not...
# Disable the table of contents until after the title section
#+OPTIONS: toc:nil
#+TOC: nil

# Obsolete...
# .emacs.d/init.el configures org-export-filter-options-functions to
# set different section number formatting for html and latex.  For
# html, generate contents without section numbers.  For latex,
# generate contents with section numbers, and redefine \numberline to
# suppress those when the toc is generated.  The modified contents for
# latex is in a scope environment; it goes after Title and before
# Introduction.

#+MACRO: S16Version (Version/Date disabled for section export)
# Benign redefinition to prevent error/abort on export.

# When the entire document is exported, the redefinition of S16version
# (which is included at the top of the file) is ignored because of
# INCLUDING ../VersionMacro.org.  (When a macro is defined twice, the
# second definition is ignored.)  When only a section is exported, the
# INCLUDE is skipped, and the second MACRO definition prevents an
# error message (undefined macro) from aborting the export.

# Is this needed?  Probably not since code is enclosed in BEGIN_EXAMPLE
# Preserve line breaks
